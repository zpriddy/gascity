# openclaw-bridge — hosting openclaw connectors on the Gas City extmsg fabric

**Proof of concept.** These bridges run [openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)'s
shipped connectors — **unmodified, straight from npm** — as Gas City extmsg
out-of-process adapters. Two connectors so far: **iMessage** (`bridge.mjs`)
and **Telegram** (`telegram-bridge.mjs`, see [below](#telegram-bridge)).
They answer the question *"can we import openclaw's connectors with almost
no work?"* with working demos:

```
incoming iMessage                                            agent session
      │                                                            ▲
      ▼                                                            │ nudge (<system-reminder> with text)
 [imsg CLI] ◄─JSON-RPC─► [openclaw connector code] ◄──► [bridge.mjs] ◄──HTTP──► [gc extmsg fabric]
 (fake on Linux,          probeIMessage                  ~250 LoC                bindings / transcript
  real on a Mac)          createIMessageRpcClient        normalize + forward     / delivery receipts
                          sendMessageIMessage
```

Run it:

```bash
cd contrib/openclaw-bridge
./demo.sh            # builds gc if needed; GC_BIN=<path> to reuse a binary
```

The demo boots an isolated gc supervisor (own `GC_HOME`, port 9870), creates a
city, starts this bridge, binds a DM conversation to an agent session, then
shows: an inbound iMessage landing in the agent session as a nudge, and the
session's reply delivered back out through openclaw's send pipeline — including
markdown→native-formatting conversion done by *their* code. Everything is
sandboxed under `/tmp/gc-openclaw-bridge-demo` and torn down on exit.

## What is openclaw's vs ours

From the published `openclaw` npm package (pinned in `package-lock.json`), the
bridge imports and runs as-is:

| openclaw export | role |
|---|---|
| `probeIMessage` | imsg CLI handshake/capability probe at startup |
| `createIMessageRpcClient` | persistent `imsg rpc --json` JSON-RPC client; watch-mode inbound notifications |
| `sendMessageIMessage` | full outbound pipeline: target parsing, markdown formatting runs, chunking, receipts |
| `resolveIMessageInboundConversationId`, `normalizeIMessageHandle`, `formatIMessageChatTarget` | the iMessage conversation/handle id model |

Ours is the thin glue (`bridge.mjs`, ~250 lines): map openclaw's inbound
payload to gc's `ExternalInboundMessage`, map gc's `PublishRequest` to a
connector send, serve the `/publish` callback, register the adapter. The
gc-facing half of that glue — the city-scoped `gcFetch` (CSRF header, timeout),
the callback server, and the register/re-register/shutdown lifecycle — is
shared across both connectors in `lib/gc-client.mjs`, so each bridge owns only
its provider-specific inbound/send mapping and the two cannot drift on
controller-facing behavior. Routing policy (which session owns a conversation,
fan-out, transcripts) stays entirely in gc — openclaw's own
routing/pairing/agent-dispatch layer is deliberately *not* hosted, which is
exactly the split gc's external-messaging fabric design intends
(`engdocs/design/external-messaging-fabric.md`).

## Wire mapping (openclaw ⇄ gc)

| openclaw `IMessagePayload` | gc `ExternalInboundMessage` |
|---|---|
| `guid` / `id` | `provider_message_id`, `dedup_key` |
| `sender` (normalized handle) | `actor.id`, dm `conversation_id` |
| `chat_id` (groups) | room `conversation_id` |
| `text` | `text` |
| `reply_to_id` | `reply_to_message_id` |
| `created_at` | `received_at` |

| gc `PublishRequest` | openclaw send |
|---|---|
| `conversation_id` (dm) | handle target (`+1555...`) |
| `conversation_id` (room) | `chat_id:N` target |
| `text` | `sendMessageIMessage(to, text, ...)` |
| `reply_to_message_id` | `replyToId` (native iMessage reply) |
| receipt `message_id` | `IMessageSendResult.messageId` (+ `guid` in metadata) |

## The fake imsg CLI

openclaw's connector drives a local `imsg` binary (macOS, talks to
Messages.app). `fake-imsg/imsg` implements the same protocol on Linux —
line-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 daemon (`rpc --json`), probe surface
(`status --json`, `rpc --help`, `send-rich --help`) — backed by two files:

- append a line to `$FAKE_IMSG_DIR/inbox.jsonl` → connector receives it as an
  incoming message (`{"text":"hi","sender":"+1555...","is_group":false}` or plain text)
- every send lands in `$FAKE_IMSG_DIR/outbox.jsonl`

To run against **real iMessage**, point `IMSG_CLI_PATH` at a real `imsg`
binary on a signed-in Mac (or an SSH wrapper script; openclaw's send path
auto-detects remote-host wrappers) and start `bridge.mjs` with `GC_CITY`,
`GC_BASE_URL` set. Nothing else changes.

## Bridge configuration (env)

| var | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GC_CITY` | (required) | city name for `/v0/city/{name}/...` |
| `GC_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8372` | gc API base (supervisor default port) |
| `GC_SCOPE_ID` | `$GC_CITY` | `scope_id` stamped on every ConversationRef |
| `BRIDGE_PORT` | `8930` | callback server gc publishes to |
| `BRIDGE_PROVIDER` / `BRIDGE_ACCOUNT_ID` | `imessage` / `default` | adapter identity |
| `IMSG_CLI_PATH` | `./fake-imsg/imsg` | imsg binary (must be an explicit path on non-Mac — openclaw rejects a bare `imsg` off-macOS) |
| `ALLOW_FROM` | (empty = allow all) | comma-separated iMessage handles; other senders are dropped at the edge with a log line, never reaching gc |

## Findings (the actual point of the PoC)

What "import openclaw connectors" costs, learned by building this:

1. **The published npm package is enough.** `dist/extensions/imessage` ships in
   the tarball with clean entry-module exports for send/probe/id-model. No
   monorepo checkout, pnpm, or build step needed.
2. **One seam is not exported:** `createIMessageRpcClient` (the watch/inbound
   client) only exists in a hash-named dist chunk under a mangled alias.
   `lib/openclaw.mjs` resolves it by scanning dist export statements. Upstream
   ask: re-export the RPC client (and the notification parser) from the
   extension's public API.
3. **Don't host their monitor/dispatch layer.** `monitorIMessageProvider` is
   hard-wired into openclaw's own pairing/agent-reply pipeline (and its dm
   policy would fight gc's routing). The right seam is one level down: RPC
   client + notification payloads. This maps cleanly onto gc's
   adapter-normalizes/core-routes split.
4. **gc contract gaps to close for parity** (tracked in beads): outbound is
   text-only (`PublishRequest` has no media/typed-payload variant), receipts
   are single-id (openclaw's `MessageReceipt` is multi-part with edit/delete
   tokens), and `AdapterCapabilities`' three booleans can't express openclaw's
   capability vocabulary. Reactions/tapbacks are skipped by this bridge for
   the same reason — no gc representation yet. Known PoC simplifications on
   the bridge itself: every publish failure is reported as `transient`, and
   the `/publish` callback has no auth token — fine against the fake backend,
   close both before pointing it at a real iMessage account.
5. **Latency note:** `POST /extmsg/inbound` took ~5s per call in the demo
   environment (bead-store side, unrelated to the connector path, which
   measured ~30ms; tracked in beads).

## Telegram bridge

`telegram-bridge.mjs` is the second connector, built to test whether the
bridge shape generalizes. It does — and Telegram is the **easier** import:

```bash
cd contrib/openclaw-bridge
./demo-telegram.sh      # Linux end-to-end demo against a fake local Bot API
npm test                # unit tests: inbound redelivery + gc client + entrypoint/loader smoke

# real Telegram: token from @BotFather, nothing else changes
GC_CITY=<city> TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token> node telegram-bridge.mjs
```

### What is openclaw's vs ours (telegram)

| openclaw export | role |
|---|---|
| `probeTelegram` | getMe handshake/capability probe at startup |
| `sendMessageTelegram` | full outbound pipeline: markdown → Telegram HTML, chunking, retries, grammY client |

Inbound is **deliberately not** openclaw code: their telegram inbound only
exists inside `monitorTelegramProvider` — the pairing/dm-policy/agent-dispatch
layer that gc replaces (same finding as iMessage's monitor, item 3 below).
Unlike iMessage there is no exported transport-level inbound seam underneath
it. But Telegram's inbound protocol is a single `getUpdates` long-poll, so the
bridge owns it in ~30 lines. The adapter-normalizes/core-routes split is
unchanged.

### Wire mapping (telegram ⇄ gc)

| Telegram update | gc `ExternalInboundMessage` |
|---|---|
| `message.message_id` | `provider_message_id` (chat-scoped, so `dedup_key` = `tg:{chat_id}:{message_id}`) |
| `message.from` | `actor` |
| `message.chat.id` | `conversation_id` (dm and room alike) |
| `message.chat.type == "private"` | `kind` dm vs room |
| `message.reply_to_message.message_id` | `reply_to_message_id` |
| `message.date` | `received_at` |

| gc `PublishRequest` | openclaw send |
|---|---|
| `conversation_id` | chat-id target |
| `text` | `sendMessageTelegram(to, text, ...)` (markdown → HTML) |
| `reply_to_message_id` | `replyToMessageId` (native Telegram reply) |
| receipt `message_id` | `TelegramSendResult.messageId` (+ `chatId` in metadata) |

### The fake Bot API server

`fake-telegram/bot-api` implements the Bot API subset the demo touches
(`getMe`, `getUpdates` long-poll, `sendMessage`, webhook no-ops) on
`http://127.0.0.1:$FAKE_TG_PORT`, backed by the same two-file model as
fake-imsg: append a line to `$FAKE_TG_DIR/inbox.jsonl` to simulate an
incoming message, every send lands in `outbox.jsonl`. The bridge reaches it
through openclaw's own `apiRoot` config — the same knob used for self-hosted
Bot API servers — so the connector code path is identical to production.

### Telegram bridge configuration (env)

| var | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GC_CITY` | (required) | city name for `/v0/city/{name}/...` |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | (required) | BotFather token (or the fake server token) |
| `TELEGRAM_API_ROOT` | `https://api.telegram.org` | Bot API root; point at the fake for demos |
| `GC_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8372` | gc API base (supervisor default port) |
| `GC_SCOPE_ID` | `$GC_CITY` | `scope_id` stamped on every ConversationRef |
| `BRIDGE_PORT` | `8931` | callback server gc publishes to |
| `BRIDGE_PROVIDER` / `BRIDGE_ACCOUNT_ID` | `telegram` / `default` | adapter identity |
| `ALLOW_FROM` | (empty = allow all) | comma-separated telegram user ids and/or usernames; other senders are dropped at the edge with a log line, never reaching gc |

### Child conversations (forum topics)

The telegram bridge implements gc's `EnsureChildConversation` contract
(`POST /child-conversation`): the child of a supergroup room is a Telegram
**forum topic**, created through openclaw's `createForumTopicTelegram`. The
child `conversation_id` encodes the full platform address —
`<chat_id>:topic:<message_thread_id>` — so publishes route into the topic
(`messageThreadId`) and inbound topic messages map back to the child
conversation (parented on the chat) without any bridge-side state. DMs and
non-forum chats are refused with a clean 400. The fake Bot API implements
`createForumTopic` + thread-aware `sendMessage` with real-API error shapes,
and `demo-telegram.sh` exercises a per-workstream thread end to end.

> **Forward-looking capability.** The bridge advertises
> `SupportsChildConversations: true` and serves `/child-conversation` through
> gc's `HTTPAdapter` transport seam, but gc has no API/service route that
> *consumes* that capability yet: no gc runtime code reads
> `SupportsChildConversations` or calls `EnsureChildConversation` outside
> tests. Today the endpoint is reachable through the `HTTPAdapter` transport
> and directly (as the demo does); the capability flag is wiring for a future
> gc-side child-conversation router, not a switch gc reads now.

### Telegram findings

6. **Telegram needed zero loader hacks.** Everything the bridge uses is on
   the extension's public `runtime-api.js` entry module — no chunk scanning
   (contrast finding 2: iMessage's RPC client). `apiRoot` is a first-class
   config field that flows into the grammY client, which is what makes the
   offline demo's fake Bot API possible with production code paths.
7. **The inbound seam differs per connector.** iMessage exposed a reusable
   transport client below the monitor layer; telegram does not (grammY
   polling is fused into `monitorTelegramProvider`). Where the platform
   protocol is simple (Telegram), owning inbound in the bridge is cheaper
   than asking upstream for an export. The PoC simplifications are shared
   with iMessage: publish failures all report `transient`, every callback
   endpoint (`/publish` and the state-changing `/child-conversation`) is
   unauthenticated, and non-text media is skipped (no gc representation —
   finding 4). Both endpoints bind `127.0.0.1`, so the gap is local-only, but
   close all of them — not just `/publish` — before pointing the bridge at a
   real account.
8. **Shared retry/drop policy; durability differs per connector.** Both
   connectors forward to gc through the same `forwardWithRetry` helper
   (`lib/inbound.mjs`), so they classify failures identically: a transient gc
   problem (5xx, 429, network/timeout) is retried, while a *permanent* non-429
   4xx — a "poison" message gc can never accept — is logged and dropped instead
   of retried forever. gc encodes that split in its status codes: a normalized-
   inbound *storage* fault (binding/route/transcript) returns 5xx so it
   redelivers, and only a schema-invalid body (422) or malformed/unroutable
   conversation (400) returns 4xx. gc dedupes inbound on
   `(conversation, provider_message_id)`, so a redelivered message after a retry
   or crash is harmless — each connector already sends a per-conversation-unique
   `provider_message_id` (the iMessage `guid`, the Telegram `message_id`). What
   differs is the redelivery *source*. Telegram is at-least-once via its poll
   offset: the bridge forwards each `getUpdates` result *before* advancing the
   offset, so a held update is redelivered on the next poll. iMessage's watch
   stream has no such cursor, so the bridge is the sole owner of a notification
   until gc accepts it: it retries transient gc failures *unboundedly while the
   process is live* (`maxAttempts: Infinity`), serialized so a stuck forward
   holds — never drops — the notifications behind it. The only unavoidable gap is
   a hard crash, or a shutdown that interrupts an in-flight forward; with no
   source to redeliver from, the bridge logs the loss and exits non-zero rather
   than claiming a clean stop (a durable `chat.db` ROWID cursor would be the
   cross-restart parity path). The policy is isolated in `lib/inbound.mjs` and
   covered by `npm test` (`test/inbound.test.mjs`) — transient-failure-then-
   redelivery, poison-update-drop, and the iMessage unbounded-retry cases — which
   runs in CI via the `openclaw-bridge` job (and `make test-openclaw-bridge`).
   That job also `node --check`s both entrypoints and smoke-loads the openclaw
   connectors (`test/entrypoints.test.mjs`, `test/openclaw-loader.test.mjs`).

A Slack/Discord bridge would follow the same shape; their plugins are
bigger but the bridge-facing surface (send adapter + inbound normalization +
id model) is the same family of exports.
