# gc dolt compact

Flatten Dolt commit history on managed databases to reduce storage, then run a
full garbage collection to reclaim the orphaned chunks. Without flags, compact
runs in scheduled mode: it skips any database below the commit-count threshold
(default 2000, `GC_DOLT_COMPACT_THRESHOLD_COMMITS`), flattens the rest, verifies
row preservation, and runs `CALL DOLT_GC('--full')`.

## Flags

- `--gc-only` — Reclaim orphaned chunks via `CALL DOLT_GC('--full')` on each
  database **regardless of commit count**, skipping the flatten path entirely.
  This is the sanctioned reclaim path for a database stranded *below* the
  flatten threshold with orphaned `oldgen` archives — for example after a prior
  flatten dropped its commit count below the threshold but its post-flatten full
  GC was deferred or never ran, so scheduled compaction skips it forever and the
  disk space is never reclaimed. Unlike a bare working-set GC, `--full` rewrites
  `oldgen`, so the orphaned history is actually freed. Refuses any database that
  carries an integrity-quarantine marker.

- `--only-db <name>` — Restrict the run to the named database. Repeatable, and
  augments `GC_DOLT_COMPACT_ONLY_DBS`. Use this to reclaim a single stranded
  database without touching the rest of the store.

- `--dry-run` — Print the intended actions without issuing any
  `DOLT_RESET` / `DOLT_COMMIT` / `DOLT_GC`.

- `--skip-fetch` — Bypass `CALL DOLT_FETCH` for every database (sets
  `GC_DOLT_COMPACT_SKIP_FETCH=1`). Against an uncredentialed git+https remote
  the fetch crashes the managed Dolt sql-server and cascades to every remaining
  database, so this opt-out lets compaction proceed from the local source of
  truth; the post-compaction remote push is deferred via a pending-push marker.
  To skip only specific known-uncredentialed databases while others fetch and
  push normally, set `GC_DOLT_COMPACT_SKIP_FETCH_DBS=<db>[,<db>...]` instead.

## Examples

```bash
# Recover a single database that scheduled compaction skips because it fell
# below the commit threshold but still holds orphaned oldgen chunks.
gc dolt compact --gc-only --only-db hq

# Preview what a full reclaim pass would touch, without mutating Dolt.
gc dolt compact --gc-only --dry-run
```
