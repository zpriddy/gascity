# config, so the sibling dolt.pid — located by parsing `--config <path>`
# from the process command line — is the authoritative ownership signal:
# present and self-referential means a healthy gc-managed instance.
# Externally-managed Dolt servers (launchd- or manually-started servers
# for unrelated apps, on their own datadir and port) also carry an
# explicit `--config` but have NO sibling dolt.pid; they are not town
# strays and must not be flagged, or health patrol automation could kill a
# healthy, unrelated server. Without these exclusions, every patrol in
# every city flags the others (and unrelated apps) as zombies on shared
# dev hosts. The `--config` parse happens inside the single bounded
# `ps -eo` + awk pass below (it already has the full args line in hand);
# only the sibling dolt.pid read is left to the shell loop, which
# iterates O(matched sql-servers) — never O(all pids/zombies) — so the
# bounded-fork invariant still holds.

# GC_HEALTH_SKIP_ZOMBIE_SCAN is a test-only escape hatch. Zombie
# enumeration spawns one `ps` per matching process, which on shared
