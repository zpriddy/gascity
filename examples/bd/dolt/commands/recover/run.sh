# detects the condition and attempts automatic recovery by calling
# the gc-beads-bd recover operation.

#              GC_DOLT_PASSWORD

# Always export DOLT_CLI_PASSWORD (even empty) so the client does not
# prompt for a password on stdin; non-TTY agent sessions would otherwise
# fail with "Failed to parse credentials: operation not supported by
# device" and the probe would falsely report writable. The write probe
# is wrapped in run_bounded so an unresponsive server — the very
# failure mode `gc dolt recover` exists to handle — cannot hang the
# script indefinitely. Mirrors the patterns established in health/run.sh.
# This table-only probe intentionally avoids DROP DATABASE; explicit
# managed probe recovery is available through `gc dolt-state reset-probe`.
