# check-eventexport-isolation.sh — guards the OSS event-export surface:
#   1. brand-free: no commercial/deployment tokens leak into the OSS projection.
#   2. one source of truth: each projection primitive is defined exactly once.
#   3. module boundary: pkg/eventexport (the published, OSS-consumable contract)
#      imports nothing from internal/.
#
# Scoped to the event-export surface so it never trips on legitimate uses of
# these tokens elsewhere in the tree (the module path, registry defaults, design
# docs, the x-gc-* API headers, etc.).
#
# Maintenance notes:
#   - BRAND below is a denylist of known commercial hosts/identifiers; EXTEND it
#     when a new one is introduced. The structural module-boundary check (#3) is
#     the airtight backstop — BRAND is the readability layer on top.
#   - The one-source check (#2) is a gofmt-dependent text match (single-line
#     'AllowedTypes = map' / 'func ...' forms). gofmt is enforced in CI, so this
#     holds; it fails safe (n!=1) if a definition is renamed or removed.
