description: Create a city, add a rig, and route work in a few minutes.

<Note>
This guide assumes you have already installed Gas City and its
prerequisites. If you haven't, start with the
[Installation](/getting-started/installation) page.
</Note>

You will need `gc`, `tmux`, `git`, `jq`, and a beads provider (`bd` + `dolt`
by default, or set `GC_BEADS=file` to skip them).

<Tip>
Oh My Zsh's `git` plugin defines a `gc` alias for `git commit --verbose`. If
`gc version` or `gc init` opens git commit instead of Gas City, use
`command gc ...` temporarily and remove the alias after Oh My Zsh loads.
See [Troubleshooting](/getting-started/troubleshooting#oh-my-zsh-git-plugin-hides-gc).
</Tip>

## 1. Create a City

```bash
gc init ~/bright-lights
cd ~/bright-lights
```

`gc init` bootstraps the city directory, registers it with the supervisor, and
starts the controller. The city is running as soon as init completes.

## 2. Add a Rig

```bash
mkdir ~/hello-world && cd ~/hello-world && git init && cd -
gc rig add ~/hello-world
```

A rig is an external project directory registered with the city. It gets its
own beads database, hook installation, and routing context.

By default, a rig keeps its canonical bead state in `rig/.beads/`. If the same
checkout is intentionally shared across multiple cities, configure that rig
with `shared_across_cities = true` or `beads_scope = "city"` so each city gets
its own scoped state under `rig/.beads/cities/<city-name>/`.

## 3. Sling Work

```bash
cd ~/hello-world
gc sling claude "Create a script that prints hello world"
```

`gc sling` creates a work item (a bead) and routes it to an agent. Gas City
starts a session, delivers the task, and the agent executes it.

## 4. Watch an Agent Work

```bash
bd show <bead-id> --watch
```
