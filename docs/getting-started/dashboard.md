The Gas City supervisor hosts a built-in web dashboard. It is a single-page app
compiled into the `gc` binary and served by the supervisor on its own listener,
so there is nothing extra to install or run.

## Open it

Start the supervisor, then open the URL it prints:

```bash
gc supervisor start
# Supervisor API listening on http://127.0.0.1:8372
# Dashboard:  http://127.0.0.1:8372/
```

If the supervisor is already running, `gc dashboard` opens it in your browser
and prints the URL too:

```bash
gc dashboard
# Opened the dashboard in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8372
```

Pass `--no-open` to print the URL without launching a browser (useful over SSH
or in scripts):

```bash
gc dashboard --no-open
# The dashboard is served by the gc supervisor at http://127.0.0.1:8372
```

`gc dashboard` does not start a server — it points your browser at the running
supervisor. The supervisor is the host, and one supervisor serves every
registered city. Pick the city you want from the switcher in the dashboard
header. If the supervisor is not running, `gc dashboard` prints how to start it
instead of opening a (dead) URL.

## What it shows

The dashboard reads the supervisor's typed API directly (same origin), so it
reflects live state: agents and their sessions, beads, mail, formula runs, and a
health view (system, local tools, per-rig store health, and the dolt store
trend).

## Security posture

The dashboard is served on the supervisor's bind address, which defaults to
loopback (`127.0.0.1`). It is intended for local, single-operator use:

- It is same-origin with the API; browser mutations carry the supervisor's
  `X-GC-Request` CSRF header.
- When the supervisor binds a non-localhost address without
  `allow_mutations`, it runs read-only and the dashboard disables its mutating
  controls.

## Turn it off

Set `GC_SUPERVISOR_DASHBOARD=0` before starting the supervisor to run a
typed-API-only supervisor with no embedded dashboard.
