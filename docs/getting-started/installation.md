## Which method should I use?

| Method | Best for | Installs deps? | Auto-upgrades? |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| [Homebrew](#homebrew-recommended) | macOS / Linux daily use | Yes (runtime deps) | `brew upgrade` |
| [Direct download](#direct-download) | CI, containers, air-gapped hosts | No | Manual |
| [Source build](#build-from-source) | Contributors, bleeding-edge | No | Manual |

**Most users should use Homebrew.** It installs all runtime dependencies
automatically and keeps `gc` on your PATH. Choose direct download when you
cannot use Homebrew (CI images, Docker layers, machines without package
managers). Choose source when you need unreleased changes or plan to contribute.

## Prerequisites

Gas City requires a small set of runtime tools. Homebrew installs all of them
for you; the other methods require manual installation.

| Tool | Required | Min version | macOS | Linux | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| tmux | Yes | — | `brew install tmux` | `apt install tmux` | Session management |
| jq | Yes | — | `brew install jq` | `apt install jq` | JSON processing |
| git | Yes | — | (built-in) | (built-in) | Version control |
| dolt | Yes | 2.1.0 or newer | `brew install dolt` | [releases](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases) | Beads data plane |
| bd (Beads CLI) | Yes | 1.0.0 | `brew install beads` | [releases](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/releases) | Issue tracking |
| flock | Yes | — | `brew install flock` | (built-in via util-linux) | File locking |
| gh | Optional | — | `brew install gh` | [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com/) | GitHub gate checks |
| Go 1.26+ | Source only | 1.26 | `brew install go` | [golang.org](https://go.dev/dl/) | Compiler |
| make | Source only | — | (built-in) | `apt install make` (or `build-essential`) | Drives `make install` |

Use a final Dolt 2.1.0 or newer. Gas City's managed Dolt checks reject older
and pre-release builds because they are below the managed bd/Dolt compatibility
floor; releases before 1.86.2 can also miss the upstream GC/writer deadlock
fix in dolthub/dolt commit `ccf7bde206`, which can hang `dolt_backup sync`
under heavy write load.

The exact versions CI pins are in [`deps.env`](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/blob/main/deps.env).

## Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install gastownhall/gascity/gascity
```

This taps the `gastownhall/gascity` formula, downloads the matching `gc`
release asset, and installs all six runtime dependencies (tmux, jq, git, dolt,
flock, beads).

Once Gas City is accepted into homebrew-core, the normal install path will be
`brew install gascity`; the `gastownhall/gascity` tap remains available for
emergency updates.

Verify the installation:

```bash
gc version
```

<Warning>
If you use Oh My Zsh with the `git` plugin, `gc` may already be an alias for
`git commit --verbose`. Run `command gc version` once to bypass the alias. For
a persistent fix, add `unalias gc 2>/dev/null` or
`zstyle ':omz:plugins:git' aliases no 'gc'` after Oh My Zsh loads in
`~/.zshrc`, or put that line in a file such as
`~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/gascity.zsh`.
</Warning>

### Upgrading via Homebrew

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade gascity
```

After upgrading, restart any running city so the supervisor picks up the new
binary:

```bash
gc service restart     # restarts the launchd/systemd service
```

`gc start` auto-regenerates the service file on each invocation, so a
`brew upgrade` followed by `gc start` always picks up template changes
(see [v0.13.3 release notes](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/releases/tag/v0.13.3)).

### Uninstalling via Homebrew

```bash
gc stop <city-path>                        # stop running city first
brew uninstall gascity
brew untap gastownhall/gascity             # remove the tap
```

## Direct download

Release tarballs are published for every tagged version. Supported platforms:

| OS | Architecture | Archive name |
|----|-------------|--------------|
| macOS (darwin) | Apple Silicon (arm64) | `gascity_VERSION_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS (darwin) | Intel (amd64) | `gascity_VERSION_darwin_amd64.tar.gz` |
| Linux | x86_64 (amd64) | `gascity_VERSION_linux_amd64.tar.gz` |
| Linux | ARM (arm64) | `gascity_VERSION_linux_arm64.tar.gz` |

### Download and install

```bash
# Set the version you want (check https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/releases)
VERSION=1.3.0

# Detect platform
OS=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
ARCH=$(uname -m)
case "$ARCH" in
  x86_64)         ARCH=amd64 ;;
  aarch64|arm64)  ARCH=arm64 ;;
esac

# Download and extract
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/releases/download/v${VERSION}/gascity_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz"
tar -xzf "gascity_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz"

# Move to a directory on your PATH
sudo install -m 755 gc /usr/local/bin/gc

# Verify
gc version
```

### Verify release artifacts

Homebrew verifies release checksums from the formula automatically. For direct
downloads, verify the archive before installing it:

```bash
ARCHIVE="gascity_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz"
CHECKSUMS="gascity_${VERSION}_checksums.txt"

curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${CHECKSUMS}"
grep "  ${ARCHIVE}$" "${CHECKSUMS}" > "${ARCHIVE}.sha256"

if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  sha256sum -c "${ARCHIVE}.sha256"
else
  shasum -a 256 -c "${ARCHIVE}.sha256"
fi
```

Release archives are also published with GitHub artifact attestations. If you
have the GitHub CLI installed, verify the downloaded archive against the
`gastownhall/gascity` repository:

```bash
gh attestation verify "${ARCHIVE}" --repo gastownhall/gascity
```

Each release also includes an SPDX SBOM asset:

```bash
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/releases/download/v${VERSION}/gascity-v${VERSION}.spdx.json"
```

### Upgrading a direct-download install

Repeat the download steps above with the new version number. The `gc` binary is
a single static file — overwriting it is safe.

<Tip>
You still need to install the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) separately when
using direct download. Homebrew handles this automatically.
</Tip>

## Build from source

Requires `make` and Go 1.26+ (pinned in `go.mod` as 1.26.4).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity.git
cd gascity
make install        # builds and installs to $(GOPATH)/bin/gc
gc version
```

To build without installing globally:

```bash
make build          # outputs bin/gc in the repo root
./bin/gc version
```

On macOS, `make build` signs the binary with a stable local codesigning
identity when one is available, which helps macOS remember local permission
grants across rebuilds. Without a stable identity, the build leaves Go's
linker-produced signature unchanged. Set `GC_SIGN_IDENTITY=<certificate name>`
to choose a specific certificate, `GC_SIGN_IDENTIFIER=<identifier>` to use a
separate local TCC identity, or `GC_ADHOC_SIGN=1` to opt into ad-hoc signing
for a local experiment. Successful local signing also removes stale
`com.apple.provenance` metadata when present.

### Contributor setup

After building, install the dev toolchain and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
make setup
make check          # runs fmt, lint, vet, and unit tests
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the full contributor workflow.

## Verify your installation

Regardless of install method, confirm everything is working:

```bash
gc version          # should print the installed version and commit
```

If that runs `git commit` instead of Gas City, your shell has a `gc` alias.
Use `command gc version` for this check and see
[Troubleshooting](/getting-started/troubleshooting#oh-my-zsh-git-plugin-hides-gc)
for the permanent fix.

Then create your first city:

```bash
gc init ~/my-city
cd ~/my-city
```

`gc init` registers the city with the supervisor, which then starts it. By the
time the command returns, the city is running.
See the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) for a complete walkthrough.

Gas City ships a JSONL archive that snapshots every bead database for
disaster recovery. By default it runs in local-only mode and keeps commits
on this host. To enable off-box backup, see
[JSONL archive push failures](/getting-started/troubleshooting#jsonl-archive-push-failures).

## Docs preview

The docs site uses [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com). Preview locally from the
repo root:

```bash
./mint.sh dev
```

Or run a link check without starting the server:

```bash
make check-docs
```
