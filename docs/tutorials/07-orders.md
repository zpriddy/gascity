description: Trigger v2 formulas — and the orchestration the orchestrator drives — on a schedule, a condition, or an event, with no human in the loop.
---

Formulas describe _what_ work looks like. Orders describe _when_ it should
happen. An order pairs a trigger with an action — a formula or a shell script.
The _orchestrator_ (`gc start` launches it) wakes every 30 seconds — a _tick_ —
and evaluates each order's trigger. When a trigger opens, the order fires, no
human dispatch needed.

For a v2 formula, firing hands the whole job to the orchestrator: it decomposes
the formula into a graph of beads, fans the ready steps out across the pool's
agents, gates each step on its dependencies, retries failures, and drives the
graph to completion outside any session — now on a schedule or in response to
events instead of a person typing `gc sling`.

This page assumes `my-city` is running with agents and formulas configured (as
built up through [Tutorial 06](/tutorials/06-beads)).

## A simple order

Orders live in an `orders/` directory at the top level of your city, alongside
`formulas/` and `agents/` — the local (root) pack's own contents, the same
structure an imported pack provides. An order imported from a shared pack reads
exactly like a local one. See [primitives](/getting-started/how-gas-city-works) for how packs,
formulas, agents, and orders relate.

```
orders/
  pancakes-check.toml
  dep-update.toml
formulas/
  pancakes.toml
```

Here's a minimal order that dispatches the `pancakes` formula from
[Tutorial 05](/tutorials/05-formulas) every five minutes:

```toml
# orders/pancakes-check.toml
[order]
description = "Cook pancakes on a timer"
formula = "pancakes"
trigger = "cooldown"
interval = "5m"
pool = "worker"
```

The `pool` field tells the orchestrator where to send the work. A _pool_ is a
named group of agents that share a work queue (you saw the bundled `dolt.dog`
pool in Tutorial 01); a single agent's name works as a pool target too, so the
examples here route to the `worker` agent from Tutorial 05. When the order
fires, the orchestrator runs the formula and writes `gc.routed_to=worker` on the
resulting work beads — the marker that the pool's `bd ready` query and the
supervisor's `scale_check` both read. Any agent in the pool can then pick the
work up.

The order name comes from the file basename (`pancakes-check.toml` →
`pancakes-check`), not from anything in the TOML.

A scaled-from-zero pool only wakes if the order produces work that is
immediately Ready — beads with no open blockers. v2 formulas (anything
declaring `[requires] formula_compiler = ">=2.0.0"`, see
[Choosing a Compiler Contract](/guides/understanding-formulas#choosing-a-compiler-contract))
guarantee this: their step beads route to the pool and any step with no open
blockers is Ready right away. Prefer v2 for new formulas.

<Accordion title="v1 formulas don't wake a scaled-from-zero pool">
A v1 formula whose root materializes as a container bead puts no
immediately-Ready work on the pool — `bd ready` filters the container out, and
the dispatcher logs a warning telling you to convert the formula to v2 before
routing it to a pool. After upgrading from an older dispatcher, drain any
already-dispatched container work with `gc order sweep-tracking --include-wisps
<order>`, or let a min-floor worker clear it, before expecting the order to fire
again from a scale-from-zero pool.
</Accordion>

Drop a new order file into `orders/` and it shows up within a minute — the
orchestrator rescans the order set as it ticks, at most once per minute. No
restart needed.

## Inspecting orders

Three commands show you what the orchestrator sees: which orders exist, what
their triggers look like, and whether any are due.

`gc order list` shows every enabled order, whether or not it has ever fired:

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc order list
NAME                 TYPE     TRIGGER      INTERVAL/SCHED  TARGET
pancakes-check       formula  cooldown     5m              worker
dep-update           formula  cooldown     1h              worker
release-notes        formula  cooldown     24h             worker
```

Your output will also include built-in housekeeping orders that ship with the
bundled core pack (`beads-health`, `gate-sweep`, `jsonl-export`, `reaper`,
etc.). Leave them alone.

The `TARGET` column is the pool the order routes to (the field is still `pool`
in the TOML).

To see the full definition:

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc order show pancakes-check
Order:  pancakes-check
Description: Cook pancakes on a timer
Formula:     pancakes
Trigger:     cooldown
Interval:    5m
Target:      worker
Source:      /Users/you/my-city/orders/pancakes-check.toml
```

To check which orders are due right now:

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc order check
NAME                 TRIGGER      DUE   REASON
pancakes-check       cooldown     yes   never run
dep-update           cooldown     no    cooldown: 59m52s remaining
release-notes        cooldown     no    cooldown: 23h59m53s remaining
```

## Running an order manually

Any order can be triggered by hand, bypassing its trigger:

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc order run pancakes-check
Order "pancakes-check" executed: wisp mc-2xz → gc.routed_to=worker
```

The bead ID (`mc-2xz`) is the dispatched work, stamped `gc.routed_to=worker` so
the pool sees it (`wisp` is the CLI's label for that v1 materialization). Exec
orders print `Order "<name>" executed (exec)`. Use this to test a new order or
kick off work that's almost due anyway.

## Trigger types

The trigger controls _when_ an order fires. Each type reads one extra field
from `[order]`:

| Trigger     | Fires when                          | Extra field            | Example                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `cooldown`  | `interval` elapsed since last run   | `interval` (Go duration) | `interval = "5m"`      |
| `cron`      | wall-clock matches the schedule     | `schedule` (5-field cron) | `schedule = "0 3 * * *"` |
| `condition` | a shell command exits 0             | `check`                | `check = "test -f /tmp/deploy-flag"` |
| `event`     | a named event hits the event bus    | `on`                   | `on = "bead.closed"`     |
| `manual`    | never — only `gc order run`         | _(none)_               | —                        |

```toml
# orders/stale-branches.toml
[order]
description = "Check for stale feature branches"
formula = "stale-branches"
trigger = "cooldown"   # swap for cron / condition / event / manual
interval = "5m"        # ...and the matching extra field above
pool = "worker"
```

Notes per trigger:

- **`cooldown`** — fires immediately on the first tick if it has never run, then
  waits `interval` since the last run. Drifts: a 3:02 run means the next is at
  3:07.
- **`cron`** — a 5-field expression (minute, hour, day-of-month, month,
  day-of-week) supporting `*`, integers, comma lists (`1,15`), and `*/N` steps.
  Unlike cooldown it hits the same wall-clock times every day. Fires at most
  once per minute.
- **`condition`** — the orchestrator runs `sh -c "<check>"` with a 10-second
  timeout each tick. Use it for external state: check a file, ping an endpoint,
  query a database. The check runs synchronously, so a slow one delays the rest
  of the tick — keep it fast.
- **`event`** — fires whenever the named event appears on the bus. Cursor-based
  tracking advances a sequence marker per firing, so the same event isn't
  processed twice.
- **`manual`** — shows up in `gc order list` and `gc order check` (always DUE
  `no`, reason `manual trigger — use gc order run`), but auto-fires never.

![Cooldown vs cron timing on two timelines: cooldown fires a fixed interval after each run ends, so its wall-clock times drift later as runs take longer; cron fires at fixed clock times no matter how long runs take.](/diagrams/excalidraw-rendered/cooldown-vs-cron.svg)

<Accordion title="Cron catch-up after a missed minute">
If no orchestrator tick landed during a scheduled minute (the orchestrator was busy
or down), the next tick fires the missed occurrence once — `gc order check`
shows the reason `cron: caught up missed occurrence`. Orders that have never run
don't backfill; they fire only on an exact match.
</Accordion>

## Formula orders vs. exec orders

An order's action is either a formula or a shell script. An exec order runs the
script on the orchestrator — no agent, no LLM, no work beads — which is the right
choice for purely mechanical work: pruning branches, running linters, checking
disk usage.

```toml
[order]
description = "Delete branches already merged to main"
trigger = "cooldown"
interval = "5m"
exec = "scripts/prune-merged.sh"   # no pool — runs on the orchestrator
```

The rules:

- Every order has either `formula` or `exec`, never both.
- Exec orders can't have a `pool` — there's no agent pipeline to route to.
- The script receives `ORDER_DIR` (the directory containing the order file) in
  its environment; pack-sourced orders also get `PACK_DIR`.
- An `[order.env]` table exports extra environment variables into the script —
  handy for tuning thresholds without editing it. `env` is exec-only.
- Default timeout is 30s for formula orders, 300s for exec orders.

## Timeouts

Each order can set a timeout:

```toml
[order]
description = "Run the linter on changed files"
formula = "lint-check"
trigger = "cooldown"
interval = "30s"
pool = "worker"
timeout = "60s"
```

For formula orders, the timeout covers only the initial dispatch — compiling
the formula, materializing its work beads, and routing them to the pool. Once
dispatched, the orchestrator drives a v2 formula's steps to completion at each
agent's own pace; the order timeout never kills work mid-flight. For exec
orders, the timeout covers the full script execution — overrun, and the process
is killed. A global cap in `city.toml`:

```toml
[orders]
max_timeout = "120s"
```

The effective timeout is the lesser of the per-order timeout and the global cap.

## Order scope

When a pack is imported into more than one rig, its orders instantiate **once
per rig** by default — usually right for an order that acts on a single rig's
work. But a sweep or health probe that already iterates over every rig
internally would then run redundantly, once per rig.

Mark such an order city-scoped so it registers exactly once, no matter how many
rigs import the pack:

```toml
[order]
description = "Sweep merged convoys across the whole city"
trigger = "cooldown"
interval = "5m"
exec = "scripts/convoy-sweep.sh"
scope = "city"          # "city" or "rig"; default "rig"
```

A `scope = "city"` order appears once in `gc order list` with no rig qualifier;
rig-scoped orders appear once per importing rig (mirroring `scope` on
`[[named_session]]`). A city-scoped order keeps the formula layer of the pack it
was scanned from, so its formula must resolve from that pack rather than from any
one rig's local `orders/` directory.

## Disabling and skipping orders

Set `enabled = false` in an order's own definition to drop it from scanning
entirely — it won't appear in `gc order list` or get evaluated:

```toml
[order]
description = "Temporarily disabled"
formula = "nightly-bench"
trigger = "cooldown"
interval = "1m"
pool = "worker"
enabled = false
```

Or skip orders by name in `city.toml` without editing their files — handy when
a pack provides orders you don't want running:

```toml
[orders]
skip = ["nightly-bench", "experimental-check"]
```

## Overrides

When a pack's order is almost right, tweak it in `city.toml` instead of copying
the file:

```toml
[[orders.overrides]]
name = "test-suite"
interval = "1m"

[[orders.overrides]]
name = "release-notes"
pool = "mayor"
schedule = "0 6 * * *"
```

Overrides match by order name and can change `enabled`, `trigger`, `interval`,
`schedule`, `check`, `on`, `pool`, `timeout`, `idempotent`, and `env`. An
override targeting a nonexistent order is an error, not a silent no-op — `gc
order` commands fail; `gc start` logs the error and continues with the unmatched
override skipped.

<Accordion title="Disambiguating overrides when an order exists both city-wide and per-rig">
Many orders expand at scan time into one instance per rig (anything in a rig's
`orders/` directory or a pack imported into a rig). When the same order appears
city-wide AND per-rig, the override must say which instance it targets via `rig`:

```toml
# Targets ONLY the city-level instance. Per-rig copies are unaffected.
[[orders.overrides]]
name = "patrol"
enabled = false

# Targets ONLY the demo-repo rig's copy.
[[orders.overrides]]
name = "patrol"
rig = "demo-repo"
enabled = false

# Wildcard: targets every instance — city-level + all rig copies.
[[orders.overrides]]
name = "patrol"
rig = "*"
enabled = false
```

A rigless override against a name that exists ONLY as per-rig copies is an
error; the message names the rigs so you know what to type. The literal `"*"`
is reserved as the wildcard token and may not be a real rig name.
</Accordion>

## Order history

Every time an order fires, Gas City creates a tracking bead labeled with the
order name. You can query the history:

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc order history
ORDER           BEAD     EXECUTED
pancakes-check  mc-3hb   2026-04-08T07:36:36Z
dep-update      mc-784   2026-04-08T06:48:12Z
pancakes-check  mc-zbd   2026-04-08T07:31:22Z
release-notes   mc-zb8   2026-04-07T13:00:01Z

~/my-city
$ gc order history pancakes-check
ORDER           BEAD     EXECUTED
pancakes-check  mc-3hb   2026-04-08T07:36:36Z
pancakes-check  mc-zbd   2026-04-08T07:31:22Z
pancakes-check  mc-9p8   2026-04-08T07:26:18Z
```

The tracking bead is created synchronously _before_ the dispatch goroutine
launches — which is what keeps the cooldown trigger from re-firing on the very
next tick. The trigger checks for recent tracking beads when deciding if the
order is due.

## Duplicate prevention

Before dispatching, the orchestrator checks whether the order already has open
(non-closed) work. If it does, the order is skipped even when the trigger says
it's due — so a still-running pancakes batch doesn't get a second one piled on
top.

The open-work check runs against the store with a bounded timeout; if the store
is so contended that the check times out, the order is skipped — it fails
closed. Orders whose dispatch is safe to repeat (sweeps and feeders where a
duplicate run is a no-op) can set `idempotent = true` to fail open instead:
on a gate timeout they dispatch anyway rather than starve.

## Rig-scoped orders

When a pack is applied to a rig, that pack's orders come along and run scoped to
that rig. Say a `dev-ops` pack includes a `test-suite` order:

```
packs/dev-ops/
  orders/
    test-suite.toml         # trigger = "cooldown", interval = "5m", pool = "worker"
  formulas/
    test-suite.toml
```

And your city applies that pack to two rigs:

```toml
# city.toml
[[rigs]]
name = "my-api"

[rigs.imports.dev_ops]
source = "./packs/dev-ops"

[[rigs]]
name = "my-frontend"

[rigs.imports.dev_ops]
source = "./packs/dev-ops"
```

```toml
# .gc/site.toml
[[rig]]
name = "my-api"
path = "../my-api"

[[rig]]
name = "my-frontend"
path = "../my-frontend"
```

Now the city has the same order running independently for each rig:

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc order list
NAME                 TYPE     TRIGGER      INTERVAL/SCHED  RIG             TARGET
test-suite           formula  cooldown     5m              my-api          worker
test-suite           formula  cooldown     5m              my-frontend     worker
```

Two rows, same name, one per importing rig. As soon as any rig-scoped order
exists, `gc order list` adds a RIG column (city-level orders show `-`). To act
on a specific instance, pass `--rig`:

```shell
$ gc order show test-suite --rig my-api
$ gc order run test-suite --rig my-api
```

These are two independent orders — each copy has its own cooldown timer,
tracking beads, and history, distinguished internally by _scoped name_
(`test-suite:rig:my-api` vs `test-suite:rig:my-frontend`). The pool target is
auto-qualified at dispatch: `pool = "worker"` becomes
`gc.routed_to=my-api/worker`, routing work to the rig's own agents rather than
the city-level pool.

## Order layering

When the same order name exists in both a pack and a local `orders/` directory
within one scope (the city, or one rig), local wins and replaces the pack
definition entirely. So a city-level `orders/test-suite.toml` with a 1-minute
cooldown overrides the `dev-ops` pack's 5-minute `test-suite` — the pack version
is ignored.

Replacement never crosses scopes, though: a rig's `test-suite` doesn't replace a
city order of the same name. As the previous section showed, those coexist as
independent scoped instances (`test-suite` vs `test-suite:rig:my-api`).

## Putting it together

Two orders: a frequent lint check (exec, no agent) and weekly release notes
(formula, dispatched to the `worker` agent from
[Tutorial 05](/tutorials/05-formulas)). The pieces are the two order files and
the formula they dispatch.

```toml
# orders/lint-check.toml
[order]
description = "Run the linter on changed files"
trigger = "cooldown"
interval = "30s"
exec = "scripts/lint-changed.sh"
timeout = "60s"
```

```toml
# orders/release-notes.toml
[order]
description = "Generate release notes from the week's merges"
formula = "release-notes"
trigger = "cron"
schedule = "0 9 * * 1"
pool = "worker"
```

```toml
# formulas/release-notes.toml
formula = "release-notes"

[requires]
formula_compiler = ">=2.0.0"

[[steps]]
id = "gather"
title = "Gather merged PRs from the last week"

[[steps]]
id = "summarize"
title = "Write release notes"
needs = ["gather"]

[[steps]]
id = "post"
title = "Post release notes to the team channel"
needs = ["summarize"]
```

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc start
City 'my-city' started

~/my-city
$ gc order list
NAME                 TYPE     TRIGGER      INTERVAL/SCHED  TARGET
lint-check           exec     cooldown     30s             -
release-notes        formula  cron         0 9 * * 1       worker

~/my-city
$ gc order check
NAME                 TRIGGER      DUE   REASON
lint-check           cooldown     yes   never run
release-notes        cron         no    cron: schedule not matched
```

The lint check fires immediately (never run + cooldown = due), then every 30
seconds. The release notes fire Monday at 9 AM: the orchestrator compiles the
three-step formula into a graph, makes `gather` Ready, and routes step beads to
the `worker` pool; `summarize` unblocks only when `gather` closes, `post` only
after `summarize`. The orchestrator drives the sequence to completion — no one
types `gc sling`, no single session babysits the run.

That's the whole idea. An order binds a trigger to an action. For a v2 formula,
the action is the full orchestration the orchestrator drives outside any session —
now gated by time, schedule, condition, or event. For an exec script, it's a
mechanical task on the same tick. Either way the orchestrator evaluates the
trigger every tick and does the work for you.
