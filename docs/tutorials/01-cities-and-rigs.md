description: Create a city, add a project as a rig, and sling your first work to an agent.
---

## Setup

Install at least one CLI coding agent (Gas City calls these "providers") and
put it on the PATH. Gas City supports many, including Claude Code (`claude`),
Codex (`codex`), Gemini (`gemini`), Grok Build (`grok`), OpenCode (`opencode`),
Groq (`groq`), and Cerebras (`cerebras`). Configure each with its token or API
key so it can run — the more the merrier.

Then install the Gas City CLI and put it on the PATH:

```shell
~
$ brew install gascity
...

~
$ gc version
1.1.1
```

> NOTE: the gascity installation is a great way to get the right dependencies in
> place, but may not be enough to keep up with the changes we're making on the
> way to 1.0. Best practice right now is to build your own `gc` binary from HEAD
> on the `main` branch of [the gascity
> repo](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity) to get the latest and greatest
> bits before running these tutorials.

New to the vocabulary? Read [How Gas City Works](/getting-started/how-gas-city-works) first — the
canonical model for the six primitives (Agent, Bead, Formula, Rig, Pack, Event)
this tutorial puts into practice. The city is the local (root) pack; it imports
shared packs.

## Creating a city

A **city** is the directory holding the agents, formulas, rigs, orders, and
local settings the orchestrator needs to run multi-agent workflows on this
machine. Inside it, a **pack** is the portable part — the definitions worth
sharing with other cities. A city is a pack plus deployment details.

Create one with `gc init`:

```shell

~
$ gc init ~/my-city
Welcome to Gas City SDK!

Choose a config template:
  1. gascity   — planning & implementation skills pack (default)
  2. minimal   — default coding agent
  3. gastown   — multi-agent orchestration pack
  4. custom    — empty workspace, configure it yourself
Template [1]:

Choose your coding agent:
  1. Claude Code
  2. Codex
  3. Gemini CLI
If you don't see your coding agent, configure it and restart the wizard.

$ gc cities
NAME     PATH
my-city  /Users/csells/my-city
```

The agent menu lists only the coding agents the wizard finds configured on
your machine — today it can probe Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and
Antigravity. If exactly one is configured, the wizard selects it without
asking.

To skip the prompts, supply the provider explicitly:

```shell
~
$ gc init ~/my-city --default-provider claude
```

Gas City created the city directory, registered it, and started it. Look
inside:

```shell
~
$ cd ~/my-city

~/my-city
$ ls
agents  assets  city.toml  commands  doctor  formulas  orders  overlays  pack.toml  template-fragments
```

At the top level of the city directory:

- `pack.toml` — the portable pack definition layer
- `city.toml` — city-local deployment and runtime settings

This city comes with a city-local `mayor` agent. The mayor's prompt lives at
`agents/mayor/prompt.template.md`, and `pack.toml` defines the always-on mayor
session that uses it. Assuming you chose the default `gascity` config template
and Claude Code, `city.toml` keeps the shared runtime settings:

```shell
~/my-city
$ cat city.toml
[workspace]
provider = "claude"

[providers]
[providers.claude]              # registers your provider against a builtin preset
base = "builtin:claude"
ready_delay_ms = 0

[daemon]
formula_v2 = true               # the v2 formula compiler, on by default (Tutorial 05)
```

```shell
~/my-city
$ cat pack.toml
[pack]
name = "my-city"
schema = 2

[imports.core]
source = "https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity.git//internal/bootstrap/packs/core"
version = "sha:<pinned commit>"

[imports.bd]
source = "https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity.git//examples/bd"
version = "sha:<pinned commit>"

[imports.gascity]
source = "https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs/tree/main/gascity"
version = "sha:<pinned commit>"

[[named_session]]
template = "mayor"
mode = "always"
```

The `[workspace]` section in `city.toml` sets shared runtime defaults such as
the provider. The `[providers.claude]` table registers your chosen provider
against the builtin `claude` preset. The v2 formula compiler is on by default,
so nothing is written for it (you'll meet formulas in
[Tutorial 05](/tutorials/05-formulas)). The `[imports]` entries
in `pack.toml` are explicit pack composition, not hidden load-time behavior.
`core` and, for cities on the default `bd` beads provider, `bd` are bundled
system packs that resolve offline from the user-global pack cache. The
`gascity` import is the public planning and implementation skills pack pinned
to the registry release embedded with this `gc` binary. If required builtin
imports go missing, `gc doctor --fix` restores them. The machine-local
workspace identity lives in `.gc/site.toml` instead, which is how `gc
cities`, `gc status`, and other commands still know this city is named
`my-city`.

The `mayor` session comes from the scaffolded `agents/mayor/` content and the
explicit `[[named_session]]` entry, so you can talk to it at any time. When
you add more agents later, Gas City creates `agents/<name>/`, with
`prompt.template.md` for the prompt and `agent.toml` for any per-agent
overrides.

Gas City also derives a worker template for each provider declared in
`city.toml`'s `[providers]` table — so `claude` is available as a template
name (and, once you add a rig, `<rig>/claude`) even though it is not a
hardcoded role. Provider-derived workers use the core pack's stock
pool-worker prompt and get `mol-do-work` as their default sling formula —
more on that in a moment. (The `mol-` prefix is v1 naming carried by the
formula's name; it doesn't change what the formula is — a reusable method.)

To check on the status of your city, use `gc status`:

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc status
my-city  /Users/csells/my-city
  Controller: supervisor-managed (PID 83621)
  API:        http://127.0.0.1:8372
  Authority: supervisor process PID 83621
  Suspended:  no

Agents:
  bd.dog                  scaled (min=0, max=2)
    bd.dog-1              stopped
    bd.dog-2              stopped
  control-dispatcher      stopped

0/3 agents running

Named sessions:
  mayor                   reserved-unmaterialized (always)
```

A named session shows `reserved-unmaterialized` until the orchestrator
materializes it; once the mayor session is up, its state reads `awake` (or
`active` — the two are equivalent).

The `dolt.dog` pool is a background utility agent from the bundled `dolt` pack
(pulled in transitively through the explicit `bd` import you saw in
`pack.toml` — the `dolt.` prefix is the import binding it arrived through).
It handles Dolt database housekeeping for the beads backend. `control-dispatcher` is platform
infrastructure: the orchestrator uses it to advance formula workflows. You don't
need to interact with either — ignore them for now.

## Adding a rig

<Note>
If another Gas City workspace is already registered (check `gc cities`),
commands inside `~/my-city` may resolve to that city and fail. Pass `--city
~/my-city` explicitly when that happens. These examples assume a single
registered city.
</Note>

In Gas City, a project directory registered with a city is called a "rig."
Rigging a project's directory lets agents work in it.

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc rig add ~/my-project
Adding rig 'my-project'...
  Prefix: mp
  Initialized beads database
  Generated routes.jsonl for cross-rig routing
Rig added.
```

Gas City derived the rig name from the directory basename (`my-project`) and
set up work tracking in it. The portable declaration lands in `city.toml`; the
path binding stays machine-local in `.gc/site.toml`:

```toml
# city.toml — portable
[[rigs]]
name = "my-project"

# .gc/site.toml — machine-local
[[rig]]
name = "my-project"
path = "/Users/csells/my-project"
```

You can also see your city's rigs with `gc rig list`:

```shell
~/my-project
$ gc rig list

Rigs in /Users/csells/my-city:

  my-city (HQ):
    Prefix: mc
    Beads:  initialized

  my-project:
    Path:   /Users/csells/my-project
    Prefix: mp
    Beads:  initialized
```

## Slinging your first work

You assign work to agents by "slinging" it. Target the rig-scoped agent
explicitly to keep the work on this rig; hop into the rig directory to inspect
the results:

```shell
~/my-city
$ cd ~/my-project

~/my-project
$ gc sling my-project/claude "Write hello world in python to the file hello.py"
Created mp-ff9 — "Write hello world in python to the file hello.py"
Attached workflow mp-6yh (formula "mol-do-work") to mp-ff9
```

One command set the whole loop in motion: sling created a work bead, attached
a workflow from the agent's default formula (`mol-do-work` — read the bead, do
the work, close it), and the orchestrator spawned a session to run it.

![Work lifecycle after a sling: you run gc sling, the beads store creates a work bead and route, the orchestrator's reconcile tick spawns a session, the agent receives a primed prompt and finds its hooked work, edits the rig and runs commands, then updates the bead's progress and closes it when done — while the event bus records every step and gc bd show --watch streams live status back to you.](/diagrams/excalidraw-rendered/work-lifecycle.svg)

Watch the bead progress with `--watch`:

```shell
~/my-project
$ gc bd show mp-ff9 --watch
○ mp-ff9 · Write hello world in python to the file hello.py   [● P2 · OPEN]
Owner: Chris Sells · Type: task
Created: 2026-04-07 · Updated: 2026-04-07

BLOCKS
  ← ○ mp-4tl: input convoy for mp-ff9 ● P2

Watching for changes... (Press Ctrl+C to exit)
```

The `BLOCKS` line is the input convoy sling created to track your bead. When
the agent finishes, the status flips from `OPEN` to `CLOSED` — and the file is
there:

```shell
~/my-project
$ ls
hello.py
```

Success! You dispatched work to an AI agent and got results back.

That was the simplest possible job: one agent, one task. The reason Gas City
exists is what happens when the job is bigger — you write a formula and the
orchestrator runs it as a graph, fanning ready steps out to many agents at once
and driving them to completion without you babysitting a session. You'll build
one of those in the Formulas tutorial.

## What's next

You've created a city, added a project as a rig, and slung work to an agent on
that rig. From here:

- **[Agents](/tutorials/02-agents)** — go deeper on agent configuration:
  prompts, sessions, scope, working directories
- **[Sessions](/tutorials/03-sessions)** — interactive conversations with
  agents, on-demand workers and persistent worker pools
- **[Formulas](/tutorials/05-formulas)** — write a method for how a job gets
  done and let the orchestrator run it as a graph: fan steps out across many
  agents, gate them on dependencies, retry failures, and drive the job to
  completion outside your session
