title: "Exec Session Provider"
---

Gas City's exec session provider delegates each `runtime.Provider` operation
to a user-supplied script. This allows any terminal multiplexer or process
manager to be used as a session backend without writing Go code.

## Usage

Set the `GC_SESSION` environment variable to `exec:<script>`:

```bash
# Absolute path
export GC_SESSION=exec:/path/to/gc-session-screen

# PATH lookup
export GC_SESSION=exec:gc-session-screen
```

## Pack-Declared Runtimes

A pack can ship (or install) a runtime executable and bind it to a
selection name in `pack.toml`:

```toml
[runtimes.cloudflare]
command = "scripts/gc-runtime-cloudflare"   # pack-relative, or PATH name
protocol = 0
```

City composition registers the name into the runtime selection
registry, so `city.toml` selects it like a builtin:

```toml
[session]
provider = "cloudflare"
```

Rules:

- A `command` containing a path separator resolves relative to the pack
  directory; a bare name resolves on PATH at session start.
- `protocol` declares the RPP version the executable speaks (version 0
  is the only version today); any other value fails composition.
- Name collisions with builtin runtimes or other packs are composition
  errors — no silent shadowing. Identical re-declarations of the same
  pack reached through a diamond import graph dedupe.
- The `pack-runtimes` doctor check verifies each declared executable is
  installed and answers the `protocol` handshake.
- Config reload enforces the same registration rules, and rebuilds the
  session provider when the declaration behind the selected name changes
  (the executable binding is fixed at provider construction).
- `gc runtime check <name>` resolves the declared name and runs the
  full conformance suite against the pack's executable.

## Calling Convention

The script receives the operation name as its first argument:

```
<script> <operation> <session-name> [args...]
```

No shell invocation — the script is exec'd directly.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Failure (stderr contains error message) |
| 2 | Unknown operation (treated as success — forward compatible) |

Exit code 2 is the forward-compatibility mechanism. When Gas City adds new
operations in the future, old scripts return exit 2 and the provider treats
it as a no-op success. Scripts only need to implement the operations they
care about.

## Operations

| Operation | Invocation | Stdin | Stdout |
|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| `start` | `script start <name>` | JSON config | — |
| `stop` | `script stop <name>` | — | — |
| `interrupt` | `script interrupt <name>` | — | — |
| `is-running` | `script is-running <name>` | — | `true` or `false` |
| `attach` | `script attach <name>` | tty passthrough | tty passthrough |
| `process-alive` | `script process-alive <name>` | process names (1/line) | `true` or `false` |
| `nudge` | `script nudge <name>` | message text | — |
| `set-meta` | `script set-meta <name> <key>` | value on stdin | — |
| `get-meta` | `script get-meta <name> <key>` | — | value (empty = not set) |
| `remove-meta` | `script remove-meta <name> <key>` | — | — |
| `peek` | `script peek <name> <lines>` | — | captured text |
| `list-running` | `script list-running <prefix>` | — | one name per line |
| `get-last-activity` | `script get-last-activity <name>` | — | RFC3339 or empty |
| `protocol` | `script protocol` | — | handshake JSON (see below) |
| `is-attached` | `script is-attached <name>` | — | `true` or `false` |
| `exec` | `script exec <name>` | command | combined output (op exit == command exit) |
| `provision` | `script provision <name>` | JSON config | — |

**Box without agent (the un-weld).** `provision` is `start` MINUS the agent
launch: it creates/prepares the box (PreStart, SessionSetup, SessionSetupScript,
SessionLive — every box step `start` runs EXCEPT spawning the agent in tmux) and
returns. The controller then launches the agent itself by exec-ing `tmux
new-session` / `respawn-pane -k` over the `exec` op, so a launch-only config
change relaunches the agent in the warm box instead of reprovisioning (B2.3). A
pack opts in by declaring `proc.provision` (and `proc.exec`, since the controller
drives the launch over `exec`); without it, the welded `start` op provisions and
launches as before, and the controller issues no `provision`/launch. The op is
gated by the `RPP-PROVISION-001` conformance requirement.

**The connection primitive (slim RPP).** `exec` is the connection op
(`RPP-CONN-001`): a carrier drives a box *through* `exec` rather than via
dedicated driving ops, and any runtime that declares an `env.*` capability
already implements it. It is **optional for now** — conformance verifies it
only when present (the output reaches the caller and the op exit mirrors the
command's exit code) — and becomes required as Gas City moves its own input
delivery and observation onto `exec`. The dedicated driving ops (`interrupt`,
`nudge`, `peek`, `clear-scrollback`, `send-keys`) are reproducible over `exec`
and are deliberately NOT conformance requirements: gc now drives input and reads
output **over `exec`** (via the tmux carrier) when a runtime implements it, and
**falls back** to the dedicated driving ops when `exec` is unsupported
(`RPP-CONN-001` answered exit 2). So a runtime that ships `exec` + tmux-in-box
needs none of the driving ops, while one that implements only the driving ops
keeps working via the fallback. (`watch-startup` is a streaming op the
request/response `exec` connection cannot carry, so it stays a dedicated op.)

### Protocol Handshake (`protocol`)

The `protocol` operation declares which Runtime Provider Protocol version
the script speaks and which optional capabilities it implements:

```json
{"version": 0, "capabilities": ["report-attachment", "report-activity"]}
```

Scripts that do not implement `protocol` (exit 2) are treated as version 0
with no optional capabilities — every pre-handshake script remains valid.
Unknown capability strings are ignored, so scripts may declare
capabilities for newer Gas City versions without breaking older ones.
Malformed handshake JSON is an error: capability probes fall back to the
no-capability behavior and the failure is reported by conformance and
doctor checks.

Capabilities:

| Capability | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| `report-attachment` | `is-attached <name>` is called and trusted; without it, sessions always read as detached and `is-attached` is never invoked. |
| `report-activity` | `get-last-activity <name>` results are treated as meaningful for idle/health decisions. |
| `proc.exec` | The `exec` op's process exit code carries the in-box command's exit code, so an exec-op exit of 2 is read as the command's own exit 2 rather than the "unknown op" sentinel (`ErrExecUnsupported`). Lets the carrier drive input/output over `exec`; without it, gc uses the dedicated driving ops (the fallback path). |
| `proc.provision` | The script implements the box-without-agent `provision` op (see Operations), so the controller provisions the box, then launches the agent over `exec` (the un-weld). Without it, `start` provisions and launches in one op. |
| `proc.stream` | Reserved (connection-plane family, parallel to `env.*`): declares the persistent bidirectional `stream` connection op (ACP over a stream, tmux pipe-pane). Sets `CanStream`. The `stream` op and its capability-gated conformance entry land with the connection rewrite. |
| `tty.attach` | Reserved: declares an interactive PTY `attach` connection op. Sets `CanAttachTTY`. |

The handshake runs once per provider instance and is cached.

### Start Config (JSON on stdin)

The `start` operation receives a JSON object on stdin:

```json
{
  "work_dir": "/path/to/working/directory",
  "command": "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions",
  "env": {"GC_AGENT": "mayor", "GC_CITY": "/home/user/bright-lights"},
  "lifecycle": "one_shot",
  "process_names": ["claude", "node"],
  "nudge": "initial prompt text",
  "pre_start": ["mkdir -p /workspace", "git clone repo /workspace"]
}
```

All fields are optional (omitted when empty).

### Startup Hints

The JSON config contains fields that the tmux provider uses for multi-step
startup orchestration. The exec provider itself is fire-and-forget — it
calls `script start` and returns immediately. Scripts may handle these
hints or ignore them:

- **`process_names`** — the tmux adapter polls for these process names to
  appear in the session's process tree (30s timeout) before considering the
  agent "started." A script can implement this by polling its backend's
  process tree after session creation, or ignore it for fire-and-forget
  behavior (like the subprocess provider does).

- **`lifecycle`** — `"one_shot"` marks a short-lived command that is
  expected to exit after handling its prompt. Providers should not require
  a persistent post-start process for one-shot starts.

- **`nudge`** — text that the tmux adapter types into the session after
  the agent is ready. Scripts that support interactive input can handle
  this in `start` (type the text after session creation) or leave it to
  the separate `nudge` operation which gc calls after `start` returns.

- **`pre_start`** — array of shell commands to run on the target
  filesystem **before** the session is created. Used for directory
  preparation, worktree creation, or other setup that must exist before
  the agent starts. Scripts should execute each command in the target
  environment before creating the tmux session. Non-fatal: warn on
  stderr if a command fails, but don't abort start.

- **`session_setup`** — array of shell commands to run on the target
  filesystem after the session is created and ready, before returning.
  Scripts should execute each command inside the session environment
  (e.g. `kubectl exec -- sh -c '<cmd>'` for K8s, `docker exec -- sh -c
  '<cmd>'` for Docker, or plain `sh -c '<cmd>'` for local providers).
  Non-fatal: warn on stderr if a command fails, but don't abort start.

- **`session_setup_script`** — path to a script on the orchestrator
  filesystem, run after `session_setup` commands. For remote providers
  (K8s, Docker), read the file locally and pipe its contents into the
  session (e.g. `kubectl exec -i -- sh < script`). For local providers,
  run directly via `sh -c`. Non-fatal like `session_setup`.

Fields that are **not** included in the JSON (gc-internal, not part of
the exec protocol):

- `ready_prompt_prefix` — prompt prefix for readiness detection (gc polls
  via `peek` after `start` returns)
- `ready_delay_ms` — fixed delay fallback (gc sleeps after `start` returns)
- `emits_permission_warning` — bypass-permissions dialog handling
- `fingerprint_extra` — config change detection metadata

The distinction: readiness polling and delay are the *caller's*
responsibility. Session setup commands are the *script's* responsibility
— they run on the target filesystem, not the orchestrator.

### Conventions

- **stdin for values**: `set-meta`, `nudge`, and `start` pass data on stdin
  to avoid shell quoting and argument length limits.
- **stdout for results**: `is-running`, `process-alive` return `true`/`false`.
  `get-meta` returns the value or empty for unset. `list-running` returns one
  name per line.
- **Idempotent stop**: `stop` must succeed (exit 0) even if the session
  doesn't exist.
- **Best-effort interrupt/nudge**: Return 0 even if the session doesn't exist.
- **Empty = unsupported**: `get-last-activity` returning empty stdout means
  the backend doesn't support activity tracking (zero time in Go).

## Writing Your Own Script

1. Start with `contrib/session-scripts/gc-session-screen` as a template.
2. Implement the operations your backend supports.
3. Return exit 2 for operations you don't support.
4. Validate with `gc runtime check ./your-script` — it runs the protocol
   handshake, the required lifecycle round-trip (start, is-running, stop,
   idempotent stop), exercises every capability the handshake declares,
   and probes optional operations (absent ones are reported, not failed).
   It exits non-zero if any check fails, so CI can gate on it.
5. Test with `GC_SESSION=exec:./your-script gc start <city>`.

### Minimal script (start/stop/is-running only)

```bash
#!/bin/sh
op="$1"
name="$2"
case "$op" in
  start)     cat > /dev/null; my-mux new "$name" ;;
  stop)      my-mux kill "$name" 2>/dev/null; exit 0 ;;
  is-running) my-mux list | grep -q "^${name}$" && echo true || echo false ;;
  *)         exit 2 ;;
esac
```

## Environment Variables

Scripts can use `GC_EXEC_STATE_DIR` (if set) as a directory for sidecar
state files (metadata, wrappers). If not set, scripts should use a
reasonable default under `$TMPDIR` or `/tmp`.

## Shipped Scripts
