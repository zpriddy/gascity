description: "Schema for city.toml — the deployment file for a Gas City instance."
---

Schema for city.toml — the deployment file for a Gas City instance. Pack definitions live in pack.toml and conventional pack directories such as agents/, formulas/, orders/, and commands/. Use [imports.*] for pack composition; legacy includes and [[agent]] fields remain visible for migration compatibility. Legacy [packs.*] entries are still accepted by the runtime for migration/fetch compatibility but are intentionally omitted from this public schema.

> **Pack format source of truth:** Public pack format and loader semantics are specified in [Gas City Pack Specification](/reference/specs/pack-spec).

> **Auto-generated** — do not edit. Run `go run ./cmd/genschema` to regenerate.

## City

City is the top-level configuration for a Gas City instance.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `include` | []string |  |  | Include lists config fragment files to merge into this config. Processed by LoadWithIncludes; not recursive (fragments cannot include). |
| `workspace` | Workspace | **yes** |  | Workspace holds city-level metadata (name, default provider). |
| `providers` | map[string]ProviderSpec |  |  | Providers defines named provider presets for agent startup. |
| `upstreams` | map[string]UpstreamSpec |  |  | Upstreams defines named model-serving endpoint presets selectable per agent via the Upstream axis (Phase C). Each maps a name → serving env (base URL + credential refs); see UpstreamSpec. |
| `imports` | map[string]Import |  |  | Imports defines named pack imports. Each key is a local binding name; the authored public contract stores a durable source plus optional version. Processed during ExpandCityPacks. |
| `defaults` | PackDefaults |  |  | Defaults holds city-level defaults that seed generated config. The canonical default-rig import table is [defaults.rig.imports]. |
| `agent` | []Agent |  |  | Agents lists all configured agents in this city. Pack-composed cities can compose agents through [imports.*] and ship without any [[agent]] block. |
| `named_session` | []NamedSession |  |  | NamedSessions lists canonical alias-backed sessions built from reusable agent templates. |
| `rigs` | []Rig |  |  | Rigs lists external projects registered in the city. |
| `patches` | Patches |  |  | Patches holds targeted modifications applied after fragment merge. |
| `beads` | BeadsConfig |  |  | Beads configures the bead store backend. |
| `session` | SessionConfig |  |  | Session configures the session provider backend. |
| `mail` | MailConfig |  |  | Mail configures the mail provider backend. |
| `events` | EventsConfig |  |  | Events configures the events provider backend. |
| `usage` | UsageConfig |  |  | Usage configures the usage-fact sink backend. |
| `dolt` | DoltConfig |  |  | Dolt configures optional dolt server connection overrides. |
| `formulas` | FormulasConfig |  |  | Formulas is the legacy [formulas] table; authored [formulas].dir is rejected at config load. Formulas live in the well-known formulas/ directory. |
| `daemon` | DaemonConfig |  |  | Daemon configures controller daemon settings. |
| `orders` | OrdersConfig |  |  | Orders configures order settings: skip list, max_timeout cap, and per-order overrides. |
| `api` | APIConfig |  |  | API configures the optional HTTP API server. |
| `chat_sessions` | ChatSessionsConfig |  |  | ChatSessions configures chat session behavior (auto-suspend). |
| `session_sleep` | SessionSleepConfig |  |  | SessionSleep configures idle sleep policy defaults for managed sessions. |
| `convergence` | ConvergenceConfig |  |  | Convergence configures convergence loop limits. |
| `doctor` | DoctorConfig |  |  | Doctor configures gc doctor thresholds and policy toggles (worktree size warnings, nested-worktree auto-prune). |
| `maintenance` | MaintenanceConfig |  |  | Maintenance configures periodic store-maintenance loops. |
| `service` | []Service |  |  | Services declares workspace-owned HTTP services mounted on the controller edge under /svc/&#123;name&#125;. |
| `github` | GitHubConfig |  |  | GitHub configures GitHub-facing repository monitors. |
| `extmsg` | ExtMsgConfig |  |  | ExtMsg configures the external-messaging fabric (default routes for inbound conversations with no binding). |
| `agent_defaults` | AgentDefaults |  |  | AgentDefaults provides root city defaults for agents that don't override them (canonical TOML key: agent_defaults). Pack-local defaults use the same table shape in pack.toml. The runtime currently applies provider, default_sling_formula, and append_fragments; the attachment-list fields remain tombstones, and the other fields are parsed/composed but not yet inherited automatically. |
| `pricing` | []ModelPricing |  |  | Pricing holds per-model cost rate overrides keyed by (provider, model). City-level entries override pack-level entries which override the defaults shipped with the pricing package. See internal/pricing for the estimation seam introduced by issue #1255 (1d). |

## ACPSessionConfig

ACPSessionConfig holds settings for the ACP session provider.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `handshake_timeout` | string |  | `30s` | HandshakeTimeout is how long to wait for the ACP handshake to complete. Duration string (e.g., "30s", "1m"). Defaults to "30s". |
| `nudge_busy_timeout` | string |  | `60s` | NudgeBusyTimeout is how long to wait for an agent to become idle before sending a new prompt. Duration string. Defaults to "60s". |
| `output_buffer_lines` | integer |  | `1000` | OutputBufferLines is the number of output lines to keep in the circular buffer for Peek. Defaults to 1000. |

## APIConfig

APIConfig configures the HTTP API server.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | integer |  |  | Port is the TCP port to listen on. Defaults to 9443; 0 = disabled. |
| `bind` | string |  |  | Bind is the address to bind the listener to. Defaults to "127.0.0.1". |
| `allow_mutations` | boolean |  |  | AllowMutations overrides the default read-only behavior when bind is non-localhost. Set to true in containerized environments where the API must bind to 0.0.0.0 for health probes but mutations are still safe. |
| `write_auth_verify_key` | string |  |  | WriteAuthVerifyKey, when set, requires every mutating request to an already-registered city — the per-city routes under /v0/city/&#123;cityName&#125; — to carry a signed write grant from a configured trusted authority. It gates all per-city writes (beads, mail, sessions, agents, and config), not only config edits. City registry creation (POST /v0/city) is not covered: a grant binds a path-resident city name, which a not-yet-created city lacks, so creation stays governed by the supervisor-registry guards. Built-in callers (the bundled gc API client and dashboard SPA) send only the CSRF header and mint no grant, so enabling this gate turns their direct city mutations away with a clear 401; such deployments front mutations through the trusted authority that mints grants instead. The value is one or more "kid:base64-ed25519-pubkey" entries, comma separated. The GC_CITY_WRITE_PUBKEY env var overrides this. Grant revocation via an epoch floor is an ops-plane control set only through the GC_CITY_WRITE_EPOCH_FLOOR env var; it has no config field. |
| `write_auth_required` | boolean |  |  | WriteAuthRequired makes a missing or empty WriteAuthVerifyKey a startup error instead of silently disabling the gate, so a config that intends to gate writes fails closed if the key is ever dropped. The GC_CITY_WRITE_REQUIRED=1 env var has the same effect. |

## Agent

Agent defines a configured agent in the city.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the unique identifier for this agent. |
| `description` | string |  |  | Description is a human-readable description shown in MC's session creation UI. |
| `dir` | string |  |  | Dir is the identity prefix for rig-scoped agents and the default working directory when WorkDir is not set. |
| `work_dir` | string |  |  | WorkDir overrides the session working directory without changing the agent's qualified identity. Relative paths resolve against city root and may use the same template placeholders as session_setup. |
| `tmux_alias` | string |  |  | TmuxAlias overrides the tmux session_name for pool and factory-created manual sessions of this agent. When unset, sessions fall back to the universal derivation ("s-&lt;beadID&gt;" for ad-hoc sessions, "&lt;basename&gt;-&lt;beadID&gt;" for pool sessions). When set, it is expanded as a Go text/template using the same PathContext fields as work_dir / session_setup (Agent, AgentBase, Rig, RigRoot, CityRoot, CityName), sanitized for tmux, and validated as an explicit session name. For pool sessions, a live-name collision appends the bead ID as a deterministic suffix. For manual `gc session new` sessions, tmux_alias becomes the explicit session_name and takes precedence over --alias, which remains the command/mail alias; duplicate explicit names fail closed. Configured named sessions keep their named-session runtime name instead of using tmux_alias. When no --alias is supplied, work_dir templates that use &#123;&#123;.Agent&#125;&#125; see the resolved tmux_alias as the concrete session identity. |
| `scope` | string |  |  | Scope defines where this agent is instantiated: "city" (one per city) or "rig" (one per rig). Omit the field for an unscoped agent instantiated in both city and rig expansion contexts. Only meaningful for pack-defined agents; inline agents in city.toml use Dir directly. Enum: `city`, `rig` |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended prevents the reconciler from spawning this agent. Toggle with gc agent suspend/resume. |
| `pre_start` | []string |  |  | PreStart is a list of shell commands run before session creation. Commands run on the target filesystem: locally for tmux, inside the pod/container for exec providers. Template variables same as session_setup. On failure, the last 4 KiB of the command's stdout/stderr is included in the error and may appear in controller and reconciler logs; avoid set -x or echoing secrets in setup commands. |
| `prompt_template` | string |  |  | PromptTemplate is the path to this agent's prompt template file. Relative paths resolve against the city directory. |
| `nudge` | string |  |  | Nudge is text typed into the agent's tmux session after startup. Used for CLI agents that don't accept command-line prompts. |
| `session` | string |  |  | Session overrides the session transport for this agent. "" (default) uses the city-level session provider (typically tmux). "acp" uses the Agent Client Protocol (JSON-RPC over stdio). The agent's resolved provider must have supports_acp = true. Enum: `acp` |
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider names the provider preset to use for this agent. |
| `upstream` | string |  |  | Upstream selects the model-serving endpoint (a key in [upstreams]) for this agent — WHO serves the model. "" (default) falls back to agent_defaults.upstream; if still empty, no upstream env is injected (ambient behavior). Switching it relaunches the agent in the warm box. |
| `start_command` | string |  |  | StartCommand overrides the provider's command for this agent. |
| `lifecycle` | string |  |  | Lifecycle controls runtime lifetime semantics. Empty uses the default long-lived session lifecycle; "one_shot" means the command is expected to do bounded work and exit cleanly. Enum: `one_shot` |
| `args` | []string |  |  | Args overrides the provider's default arguments. |
| `prompt_mode` | string |  | `arg` | PromptMode controls how prompts are delivered: "arg", "flag", or "none". Enum: `arg`, `flag`, `none` |
| `prompt_flag` | string |  |  | PromptFlag is the CLI flag used to pass prompts when prompt_mode is "flag". |
| `ready_delay_ms` | integer |  |  | ReadyDelayMs is milliseconds to wait after launch before considering the agent ready. |
| `ready_prompt_prefix` | string |  |  | ReadyPromptPrefix is the string prefix that indicates the agent is ready for input. |
| `process_names` | []string |  |  | ProcessNames lists process names to look for when checking if the agent is running. |
| `emits_permission_warning` | boolean |  |  | EmitsPermissionWarning indicates whether the agent emits permission prompts that should be suppressed. |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env sets additional environment variables for the agent process. |
| `option_defaults` | map[string]string |  |  | OptionDefaults overrides the provider's effective schema defaults for this agent. Keys are option keys, values are choice values. Applied on top of the provider's OptionDefaults (agent keys win). Example: option_defaults = &#123; permission_mode = "plan", model = "sonnet" &#125; |
| `max_active_sessions` | integer |  |  | MaxActiveSessions is the agent-level cap on concurrent sessions. Nil means inherit from rig, then workspace, then unlimited. Replaces pool.max. |
| `min_active_sessions` | integer |  |  | MinActiveSessions is the minimum number of sessions to keep alive. Agent-level only. Counts against rig/workspace caps. Replaces pool.min. This controls pool sessions independently of [[named_session]] mode="always"; both produce sessions, and gc doctor reports accidental combinations. |
| `scale_check` | string |  |  | ScaleCheck is a shell command template whose output reports new unassigned session demand. In bead-backed reconciliation this is additive: assigned work is resumed separately, and ScaleCheck reports only how many new generic sessions to start, still bounded by all cap levels. Legacy no-store evaluation continues to treat the output as the desired session count. If it contains Go template placeholders, gc expands them using the same PathContext fields as work_dir and session_setup (Agent, AgentBase, Rig, RigRoot, CityRoot, CityName) before running the command. |
| `drain_timeout` | string |  | `5m` | DrainTimeout is the maximum time to wait for a session to finish its current work before force-killing it during scale-down. Duration string (e.g., "5m", "30m", "1h"). Defaults to "5m". |
| `on_boot` | string |  |  | OnBoot is a shell command template run once at controller startup for this agent. If it contains Go template placeholders, gc expands them using the same PathContext fields as work_dir and session_setup (Agent, AgentBase, Rig, RigRoot, CityRoot, CityName) before running the command. |
| `on_death` | string |  |  | OnDeath is a shell command template run when a session dies unexpectedly. If it contains Go template placeholders, gc expands them using the same PathContext fields as work_dir and session_setup (Agent, AgentBase, Rig, RigRoot, CityRoot, CityName) before running the command. |
| `namepool` | string |  |  | Namepool is the path to a plain text file with one name per line. When set, sessions use names from the file as display aliases. |
| `work_query` | string |  |  | WorkQuery is the shell command template to find available work for this agent. If it contains Go template placeholders, gc expands them using the same PathContext fields as work_dir and session_setup (Agent, AgentBase, Rig, RigRoot, CityRoot, CityName) before probe, hook, and prompt-context execution. Used by gc hook and available in prompt templates as &#123;&#123;.WorkQuery&#125;&#125;. If unset, Gas City uses a three-tier default query:   1. in_progress work assigned to this session/alias (crash recovery)   2. ready work assigned to this session/alias (pre-assigned work)   3. ready unassigned work with gc.routed_to=&lt;qualified-name&gt; When the controller probes for demand without session context, only the routed_to tier applies. Override to integrate with external task systems. |
| `sling_query` | string |  |  | SlingQuery is the command template to route a bead to this session config. If it contains Go template placeholders, gc expands them using the same PathContext fields as work_dir and session_setup (Agent, AgentBase, Rig, RigRoot, CityRoot, CityName) before replacing &#123;&#125; with the bead ID. Used by gc sling to make a bead visible to the target's work_query. The placeholder &#123;&#125; is replaced with the bead ID at runtime. Default for all agents: "bd update &#123;&#125; --set-metadata gc.routed_to=&lt;qualified-name&gt;". Routing is metadata-based; sling stamps the target template and the reconciler/scale_check paths decide when sessions are created. Custom sling_query and work_query can be overridden independently. |
| `idle_timeout` | string |  |  | IdleTimeout is the maximum time an agent session can be inactive before the controller kills and restarts it. Duration string (e.g., "15m", "1h"). Empty (default) disables idle checking. |
| `max_session_age` | string |  |  | MaxSessionAge is the maximum wall-clock lifetime of a single runtime session before the controller preemptively restarts it. Duration string (e.g., "5h"). Empty (default) disables preemptive restarts. The restart is idle-gated: sessions with a pending interaction or an in-progress assigned work bead are left alone until they settle.  Motivation: provider SDKs that cache credentials at session start (e.g., Claude Code via Bedrock) can wedge when the underlying token expires if the SDK doesn't re-chain providers. Cycling long-running sessions before the token-expiry window prevents that failure mode without requiring upstream provider fixes. |
| `max_session_age_jitter` | string |  |  | MaxSessionAgeJitter bounds random jitter added to MaxSessionAge on a per-session basis so a fleet of identically-configured agents doesn't synchronize restarts. Duration string (e.g., "15m"). Empty or 0 disables jitter (every session restarts at exactly MaxSessionAge). Ignored when MaxSessionAge is unset. |
| `sleep_after_idle` | string |  |  | SleepAfterIdle overrides idle sleep policy for this agent. Accepts a duration string (e.g., "30s") or "off". |
| `install_agent_hooks` | []string |  |  | InstallAgentHooks overrides workspace-level install_agent_hooks for this agent. When set, replaces (not adds to) the workspace default. |
| `skills` | []string |  |  | Skills is a tombstone field retained for v0.15.1 backwards compatibility. Accepted during parse for migration visibility, but attachment-list fields are accepted but ignored by the active materializer. |
| `mcp` | []string |  |  | MCP is a tombstone field retained for v0.15.1 backwards compatibility. Accepted during parse for migration visibility, but attachment-list fields are accepted but ignored by the active materializer. |
| `hooks_installed` | boolean |  |  | HooksInstalled overrides automatic hook detection. Set to true when hooks are manually installed (e.g., merged into the project's own hook config) and auto-installation via install_agent_hooks is not desired. When true, the agent is treated as hook-enabled for startup behavior: no prime instruction in beacon and no delayed nudge. Interacts with install_agent_hooks — set this instead when hooks are pre-installed. |
| `session_setup` | []string |  |  | SessionSetup is a list of shell commands run after session creation. Each command is a template string supporting placeholders: &#123;&#123;.Session&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.Agent&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.AgentBase&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.Rig&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.RigRoot&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.CityRoot&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.CityName&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.WorkDir&#125;&#125;. Commands run in gc's process (not inside the agent session) via sh -c. On failure, the last 4 KiB of the command's stdout/stderr is included in the error and may appear in controller and reconciler logs; avoid set -x or echoing secrets in setup commands. |
| `session_setup_script` | string |  |  | SessionSetupScript is the path to a script run after session_setup commands. Relative paths resolve against the declaring config file's directory (pack-safe). Paths prefixed with "//" resolve against the city root. The script receives context via environment variables (GC_SESSION plus existing GC_* vars). On failure, the last 4 KiB of the script's stdout/stderr is included in the error and may appear in controller and reconciler logs; avoid set -x or echoing secrets in setup scripts. |
| `session_live` | []string |  |  | SessionLive is a list of shell commands that are safe to re-apply without restarting the agent. Run at startup (after session_setup) and re-applied on config change without triggering a restart. Must be idempotent. Typical use: tmux theming, keybindings, status bars. Same template placeholders as session_setup. On failure, the last 4 KiB of the command's stdout/stderr is included in the error and may appear in controller and reconciler logs; avoid set -x or echoing secrets in setup commands. |
| `overlay_dir` | string |  |  | OverlayDir is a directory whose contents are recursively copied (additive) into the agent's working directory at startup. Existing files are not overwritten. Relative paths resolve against the declaring config file's directory (pack-safe). |
| `default_sling_formula` | string |  |  | DefaultSlingFormula is the formula name automatically applied via --on when beads are slung to this agent, unless --no-formula is set. Example: "mol-polecat-work" |
| `inject_fragments` | []string |  |  | InjectFragments lists named template fragments to append to this agent's rendered prompt. Fragments come from shared template directories across all loaded packs. Each name must match a &#123;&#123; define "name" &#125;&#125; block. |
| `append_fragments` | []string |  |  | AppendFragments is the V2 per-agent alias for prompt fragment injection. It layers after InjectFragments and before inherited/default fragments. |
| `inject_assigned_skills` | boolean |  |  | InjectAssignedSkills controls whether gc appends an "assigned skills" appendix to the agent's rendered prompt. The appendix lists every skill visible to this agent, partitioned into (assigned-to-you, shared-with-every-agent), so agents sharing a scope-root sink can tell which skills are their specialization vs which are the city-wide set.  Pointer tri-state:   nil   -&gt; inherit: inject when the agent has a vendor sink   *true -&gt; explicitly inject (equivalent to the default)   *false -&gt; disable; the template is responsible for rendering             any skill guidance itself |
| `attach` | boolean |  |  | Attach controls whether the agent's session supports interactive attachment (e.g., tmux attach). When false, the agent can use a lighter runtime (subprocess instead of tmux). Defaults to true. |
| `depends_on` | []string |  |  | DependsOn lists agent names that must be awake before this agent wakes. Used for dependency-ordered startup and shutdown. Validated for cycles at config load time. |
| `resume_command` | string |  |  | ResumeCommand is the full shell command to run when resuming this agent. Supports &#123;&#123;.SessionKey&#125;&#125; template variable. When set, takes precedence over the provider's ResumeFlag/ResumeStyle. Example:   "claude --resume &#123;&#123;.SessionKey&#125;&#125; --dangerously-skip-permissions" |
| `wake_mode` | string |  |  | WakeMode controls context freshness across sleep/wake cycles. "resume" (default): reuse provider session key for conversation continuity. "fresh": start a new provider session on every wake (polecat pattern). Enum: `resume`, `fresh` |
| `mouse_mode` | string |  |  | MouseMode controls whether tmux mouse mode is preserved for this agent. "on" leaves the session's mouse setting alone for human-attached sessions; "off" or empty preserves the SDK's default mouse-off startup behavior for headless sessions. Enum: `on`, `off` |

## AgentDefaults

AgentDefaults provides agent defaults declared via [agent_defaults] in city.toml or pack.toml.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider is the default provider name for agents that do not set their own provider. It also counts as a configured provider for implicit agent injection. |
| `model` | string |  |  | Model is the parsed/composed default model name for agents (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-6"), but it is not yet auto-applied at runtime. Agents with their own model override would take precedence. |
| `upstream` | string |  |  | Upstream is the default model-serving endpoint (a key in [upstreams]) for agents that do not set their own upstream (Phase C — the Upstream axis). Applied to agents with an empty Upstream by ApplyAgentDefaults. |
| `wake_mode` | string |  |  | WakeMode is the parsed/composed default wake mode ("resume" or "fresh"), but it is not yet auto-applied at runtime. Enum: `resume`, `fresh` |
| `default_sling_formula` | string |  |  | DefaultSlingFormula is the default formula used for agents that inherit [agent_defaults]. Explicit agents only receive this value when agent_defaults.default_sling_formula is set; implicit multi-session configs are seeded with "mol-do-work" elsewhere when no explicit default is set. |
| `allow_overlay` | []string |  |  | AllowOverlay is parsed and composed as a config-level allowlist for session overlays, but it is not yet inherited onto agents automatically at runtime. |
| `allow_env_override` | []string |  |  | AllowEnvOverride is parsed and composed as a config-level allowlist for session env overrides, but it is not yet inherited onto agents automatically at runtime. Names must match ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]&#123;0,127&#125;$. |
| `append_fragments` | []string |  |  | AppendFragments lists named template fragments to auto-append to .template.md prompts after rendering. Legacy .md.tmpl prompts are still supported during the transition; plain .md remains inert. V2 migration convenience — replaces global_fragments/inject_fragments for config-wide defaults. |
| `skills` | []string |  |  | Skills is a tombstone field retained for v0.15.1 backwards compatibility. Parsed and composed for migration visibility, but attachment-list fields are accepted but ignored by the active materializer. |
| `mcp` | []string |  |  | MCP is a tombstone field retained for v0.15.1 backwards compatibility. Parsed and composed for migration visibility, but attachment-list fields are accepted but ignored by the active materializer. |

## AgentOverride

AgentOverride modifies a pack-stamped agent for a specific rig.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `agent` | string | **yes** |  | Agent is the name of the pack agent to override (required). |

| `scope` | string |  |  | Scope overrides the agent's scope ("city" or "rig"). |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended sets the agent's suspended state. |
| `pool` | PoolOverride |  |  | Pool overrides legacy [pool] fields that map to session scaling. |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env adds or overrides environment variables. |
| `env_remove` | []string |  |  | EnvRemove lists env var keys to remove. |
| `pre_start` | []string |  |  | PreStart overrides the agent's pre_start commands. |
| `prompt_template` | string |  |  | PromptTemplate overrides the prompt template path. Relative paths resolve against the declaring config file's directory (pack-safe). Paths prefixed with "//" resolve against the city root. |
| `session` | string |  |  | Session overrides the session transport ("acp"). |
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider overrides the provider name. |
| `upstream` | string |  |  | Upstream overrides the model-serving endpoint selection (Phase C). |
| `args` | []string |  |  | Args overrides the provider's default arguments. Leave unset to keep the pack-defined args; set to an empty list to clear them; set to a populated list to replace them entirely (full replace, not append). |
| `start_command` | string |  |  | StartCommand overrides the start command. |
| `lifecycle` | string |  |  | Lifecycle overrides the runtime lifecycle ("one_shot" or empty). Enum: `one_shot` |
| `nudge` | string |  |  | Nudge overrides the nudge text. |
| `idle_timeout` | string |  |  | IdleTimeout overrides the idle timeout duration string (e.g., "30s", "5m", "1h"). |
| `max_session_age` | string |  |  | MaxSessionAge overrides the max session age. Duration string (e.g., "5h"). Empty disables preemptive restart. |
| `max_session_age_jitter` | string |  |  | MaxSessionAgeJitter overrides the jitter added on top of MaxSessionAge. Duration string (e.g., "15m"). Empty disables jitter. |
| `sleep_after_idle` | string |  |  | SleepAfterIdle overrides idle sleep policy for this agent. Accepts a duration string (e.g., "30s") or "off". |
| `install_agent_hooks` | []string |  |  | InstallAgentHooks overrides the agent's install_agent_hooks list. |
| `skills` | []string |  |  | Skills is a tombstone field retained for v0.15.1 backwards compatibility. Parsed for migration visibility, but attachment-list fields are accepted but ignored by the active materializer. |
| `mcp` | []string |  |  | MCP is a tombstone field retained for v0.15.1 backwards compatibility. Parsed for migration visibility, but attachment-list fields are accepted but ignored by the active materializer. |
| `hooks_installed` | boolean |  |  | HooksInstalled overrides automatic hook detection. |
| `inject_assigned_skills` | boolean |  |  | InjectAssignedSkills overrides Agent.InjectAssignedSkills (see that field for semantics). |
| `session_setup` | []string |  |  | SessionSetup overrides the agent's session_setup commands. |
| `session_setup_script` | string |  |  | SessionSetupScript overrides the agent's session_setup_script path. Relative paths resolve against the declaring config file's directory (pack-safe). Paths prefixed with "//" resolve against the city root. |

| `inject_fragments` | []string |  |  | InjectFragments overrides the agent's inject_fragments list. Leave this field unset to keep inherited fragments; JSON callers may send null for the same no-op. Set an empty list to clear fragments; set a populated list to replace fragments. |
| `append_fragments` | []string |  |  | AppendFragments appends named template fragments to this agent's rendered prompt. It is the V2 spelling for per-agent fragment selection. |
| `pre_start_append` | []string |  |  | PreStartAppend appends commands to the agent's pre_start list (instead of replacing). Applied after PreStart if both are set. |

| `attach` | boolean |  |  | Attach overrides the agent's attach setting. |
| `depends_on` | []string |  |  | DependsOn overrides the agent's dependency list. |

| `mouse_mode` | string |  |  | MouseMode overrides whether tmux mouse mode is preserved ("on" or "off"). Enum: `on`, `off` |
| `pre_start_append` | []string |  |  | PreStartAppend appends commands to the agent's pre_start list (instead of replacing). Applied after PreStart if both are set. |
| `session_setup_append` | []string |  |  | SessionSetupAppend appends commands to the agent's session_setup list. |
| `session_live_append` | []string |  |  | SessionLiveAppend appends commands to the agent's session_live list. |
| `install_agent_hooks_append` | []string |  |  | InstallAgentHooksAppend appends to the agent's install_agent_hooks list. |

| `option_defaults` | map[string]string |  |  | OptionDefaults adds or overrides provider option defaults for this agent. Keys are option keys, values are choice values. Merges additively (patch keys win over existing agent keys). Example: option_defaults = &#123; model = "sonnet" &#125; |

## BeadPolicyConfig

BeadPolicyConfig holds storage and retention defaults for a named bead use.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `storage` | string |  |  | Storage selects the intended persistence tier: "history", "no_history", or "ephemeral". Creation paths apply this incrementally as they opt in. Enum: `history`, `no_history`, `ephemeral` |
| `delete_after_close` | string |  |  | DeleteAfterClose deletes matching GC-owned beads after they have been closed for this duration. Accepts Go duration syntax plus whole-day "d" units, e.g. "7d" or "1d12h". ApplyBeadPolicyDefaults fills in a non-empty default for recognized policy types (order_tracking: "7d"), so this field is populated after config load even when the city.toml omits it. |

## BeadsConfig

BeadsConfig holds bead store settings.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string |  | `bd` | Provider selects the bead store backend: "bd" (default, Dolt-backed), "file", or "exec:&lt;script&gt;" for a user-supplied script. The "sqlite", "sqlite-cgo", and "coordstore" coordination-store providers were removed and now hard-error; migrate to "doltlite" or remove the setting. |
| `backend` | string |  |  | Backend selects the bd storage engine when Provider is "bd". Empty defaults to "dolt"; T3Code uses "doltlite" for local dev stores. |
| `event_hooks` | boolean |  | `true` | EventHooks controls installation of the bead event-forwarding hooks (.beads/hooks/on_create,on_update,on_close) that shell out to `gc event emit` on every bead write. Defaults to true. Set to false once the controller's native cache-events already observe bead changes (the bd_hooks doctor gate): the lifecycle then removes the event hooks (leaving git hooks untouched) and stops reinstalling them, clearing the per-write churn and the native-store gate. |
| `bd_compatibility` | string |  |  | BDCompatibility selects the bd CLI semantics Gas City may rely on. Empty defaults to "bd-1.0.4", which keeps claimable work history-backed and avoids bd ready/list flags that are unavailable or incomplete in bd 1.0.4. Enum: `bd-1.0.4`, `bd-1.0.5` |
| `policies` | map[string]BeadPolicyConfig |  |  | Policies defines per-bead-use storage and garbage-collection defaults. Policy names are interpreted by higher-level systems; unknown names are preserved so packs can stage future policy classes without breaking load. |

## ChatSessionsConfig

ChatSessionsConfig configures chat session behavior.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `idle_timeout` | string |  |  | IdleTimeout is the duration after which a detached chat session is auto-suspended. Duration string (e.g., "30m", "1h"). 0 = disabled. |
| `grace_period` | string |  |  | GracePeriod is the duration after creation during which a manual session is protected from idle-sleep scale-to-zero. Duration string (e.g., "10m"). Empty = use default (10m). "0" = disabled. |

## ConvergenceConfig

ConvergenceConfig holds convergence loop limits.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `max_per_agent` | integer |  | `2` | MaxPerAgent is the maximum number of active convergence loops per agent in each bead store scope. City/HQ and each bound rig enforce the limit independently. 0 means use default (2). |
| `max_total` | integer |  | `10` | MaxTotal is the maximum total number of active convergence loops. 0 means use default (10). |

## DaemonConfig

DaemonConfig holds controller daemon settings.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `formula_v2` | boolean |  | `true` | FormulaV2 enables formula compiler v2 workflow infrastructure: compiler-v2 workflow compilation, batch graph-apply bead creation, and routing to the core pack's control-dispatcher worker. Requires bd with --graph support. Default: ENABLED. A nil pointer means the default-on behavior and is OMITTED from generated configs (so auto-generated city.toml files never pin the default and never accidentally write formula_v2=false); an explicit formula_v2=false (or the deprecated graph_workflows=false alias) is preserved as a non-nil false. Read the effective value via FormulaV2Enabled(), never the field. |
| `graph_workflows` | boolean |  |  | GraphWorkflows is the deprecated predecessor of FormulaV2. Retained for backwards compatibility as an alias. Explicit formula_v2 wins. |
| `patrol_interval` | string |  | `30s` | PatrolInterval is the health patrol interval. Duration string (e.g., "30s", "5m", "1h"). Defaults to "30s". |
| `max_restarts` | integer |  | `5` | MaxRestarts is the maximum number of agent restarts within RestartWindow before the agent is quarantined. 0 means unlimited (no crash loop detection). Defaults to 5. |
| `restart_window` | string |  | `1h` | RestartWindow is the sliding time window for counting restarts. Duration string (e.g., "30s", "5m", "1h"). Defaults to "1h". |
| `session_circuit_breaker` | boolean |  |  | SessionCircuitBreaker enables the named-session respawn circuit breaker. When enabled, the controller suppresses no-progress named-session respawns after the configured restart threshold is exceeded. |
| `session_circuit_breaker_max_restarts` | integer |  | `5` | SessionCircuitBreakerMaxRestarts overrides MaxRestarts for the named-session respawn circuit breaker. Nil reuses MaxRestartsOrDefault. 0 disables the circuit breaker even when SessionCircuitBreaker is true. |
| `session_circuit_breaker_window` | string |  | `1h` | SessionCircuitBreakerWindow overrides RestartWindow for the named-session respawn circuit breaker. Empty reuses RestartWindowDuration. |
| `session_circuit_breaker_reset_after` | string |  |  | SessionCircuitBreakerResetAfter is the cooldown before an open named-session breaker resets automatically. Empty defaults to 2 * SessionCircuitBreakerWindowDuration. |
| `shutdown_timeout` | string |  | `5s` | ShutdownTimeout is the time to wait after sending Ctrl-C before force-killing agents during shutdown. Duration string (e.g., "5s", "30s"). Set to "0s" for immediate kill. Defaults to "5s". |
| `dolt_stop_timeout` | string |  | `30s` | DoltStopTimeout is the SIGTERM→SIGKILL grace period for the managed dolt subprocess during stop, unregister, restart, and startup/recovery cleanup. Independent of ShutdownTimeout (which gates agent drain) so a slow session drain cannot steal dolt's flush window. Duration string (e.g., "30s", "1m"). A too-short value risks SIGKILL during a journal index update or manifest rotation, which corrupts dolt's chunk journal (see gastownhall/gascity#2090). Defaults to "30s", which absorbs the longest observed flush window on commodity SSDs without unduly delaying unregister. Set to "0s" for immediate SIGKILL with no grace. Negative values are rejected at config load. Note: when a city is stopped via the controller (`gc stop` while a controller is running), the standalone controller-stop wait budget is `shutdown_timeout` + 15s (20s at the default `shutdown_timeout` of "5s"); a `dolt_stop_timeout` larger than that budget can be cut short on that path even though the direct stop/unregister path always honors the full grace. |
| `dolt_start_address_in_use_retry_window` | string |  | `30s` | DoltStartAddressInUseRetryWindow is how long the managed dolt start path waits on the originally requested port when bind fails with "address already in use" before falling back to a higher port. The common cause is a TIME_WAIT socket left by an abrupt stop of a sibling dolt subprocess (external SIGTERM, supervisor restart, OOM kill); on Linux the listening-socket slot typically frees within ~30s. Falling back immediately publishes the rebound port to provider state, after which `recoverManagedDoltShouldReuseExisting` keeps accepting the rebound instance as canonical and consumers hardcoded to the original port stay broken until the orphan is killed. Duration string (e.g., "30s", "1m"). Set to "0s" to disable the retry (legacy fall-back- immediately behavior). Defaults to "30s". Each port is waited on at most once per startManagedDoltProcessWithOptions invocation, so the worst-case wall time per startup is bounded by (DoltStartAddressInUseRetryWindow + per-attempt-startup) × min(5, distinct-ports-tried) rather than DoltStartAddressInUseRetryWindow × 5. Negative values are rejected at config load. |
| `wisp_gc_interval` | string |  |  | WispGCInterval is how often the garbage collector for wisps runs. A wisp is an ephemeral bead produced by a v1 formula run; this knob controls how often the closed ones are swept. Duration string (e.g., "5m", "1h"). Wisp GC is disabled unless both WispGCInterval and WispTTL are set. |
| `wisp_ttl` | string |  |  | WispTTL is how long a closed wisp (an ephemeral v1 formula-run bead) survives before being purged. Duration string (e.g., "24h", "7d"). Wisp GC is disabled unless both WispGCInterval and WispTTL are set. |
| `drift_drain_timeout` | string |  | `2m` | DriftDrainTimeout is the maximum time to wait for an agent to acknowledge a drain signal during a config-drift restart. If the agent doesn't ack within this window, the controller force-kills and restarts it. Duration string (e.g., "2m", "5m"). Defaults to "2m". |
| `observe_paths` | []string |  |  | ObservePaths lists extra directories to search for Claude JSONL session files (e.g., aimux session paths). The default search path (~/.claude/projects/) is always included. |
| `probe_concurrency` | integer |  | `8` | ProbeConcurrency bounds the number of concurrent bd subprocess probes issued by the pool scale_check and work_query paths. bd serializes on a shared dolt sql-server, so unbounded parallelism causes contention. Nil (unset) defaults to 8. Set higher for workspaces with a fast dedicated dolt server, or lower to reduce contention on slow storage. |
| `max_wakes_per_tick` | integer |  | `5` | MaxWakesPerTick caps how many sessions the reconciler may start in a single tick. Fresh generic pool session-bead creation uses the same budget so the controller does not materialize more ordinary pool sessions than it can wake. Bounded dependency-floor prerequisites are exempt. Nil (unset) defaults to 5. Values &lt;= 0 are treated as the default — set a positive integer to override. |
| `nudge_dispatcher` | string |  | `legacy` | NudgeDispatcher selects how queued nudges get delivered to running sessions. "legacy" (default) auto-spawns a per-session `gc nudge poll` process that polls the file-backed queue every 2s. "supervisor" runs the delivery loop inside the city runtime instead, with a unix-socket wake fast path triggered by enqueue, eliminating the per-session bd shellout storm. Enum: `legacy`, `supervisor` |
| `auto_restart_on_drift` | boolean |  | `true` | AutoRestartOnDrift controls whether `gc start` automatically restarts the supervisor when it detects the running supervisor's binary or pack snapshot has drifted from on-disk state. Nil (unset) defaults to true — operators get the correct-by-default behavior. Set to false as a global kill switch (e.g., for production cities where a rebuild on the host should not auto-restart the supervisor). |
| `auto_reap_closed_bead_worktrees` | boolean |  | `false` | AutoReapClosedBeadWorktrees controls whether the reconciler patrol automatically removes per-bead git worktrees once their associated work bead reaches closed status. Only worktrees with a clean working tree, no unpushed commits, and no stashes are removed; unsafe worktrees are logged as warnings and left in place for operator review. Session home directories (agent template directories) are never touched. Defaults to false. Set to true to enable automated worktree cleanup. |
| `start_ready_timeout` | string |  | `5m` | StartReadyTimeout is how long `gc start` and `gc register` wait for the supervisor to report the city as Running. Cities with many registered or adopted sessions take longer to start because the per-tick wake budget (max_wakes_per_tick) throttles startup: wall time to wake N sessions is roughly ceil(N / max_wakes_per_tick) * patrol_interval. At the defaults (5 wakes / 30s), ~40 sessions need ~4 minutes. Duration string (e.g., "5m", "10m"). Defaults to DefaultStartReadyTimeout (5m). When set, this value replaces the default start/register budget; [session].startup_timeout may still extend the effective wait for a slow single session. |
| `tick_debounce` | string |  |  | TickDebounce coalesces bursty event-driven ticks (pokeCh, controlDispatcherCh) within this window. A first event in a quiet period arms a timer; subsequent events arriving before the timer fires are dropped (the single delayed tick re-reads authoritative state covering all collapsed events). Zero (the default) disables debouncing — each event fires its own tick, matching pre-existing behavior. Duration string (e.g., "250ms", "500ms"). Trade-off: adds tick latency up to this value when set. |
| `auto_prune_worker_dir` | boolean |  | `true` | AutoPruneWorkerDir controls whether the reconciler removes a pool-managed session's worker_dir (agent worktree) after the session bead is closed. Removal is gated on: path lives under the city's .gc/worktrees/ tree, clean working tree, no unpushed commits, no stashed work. Nil (unset) defaults to true so pool worktrees do not accumulate without bound across pool recycles. Set to false to retain worktrees for post-session diagnostics. |

## DoctorConfig

DoctorConfig holds settings for the gc doctor surface.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `worktree_rig_warn_size` | string |  | `10GB` | WorktreeRigWarnSize is the per-rig warning threshold for the total disk footprint under .gc/worktrees/&lt;rig&gt;/. Reported by the worktree-disk-size check. Go-style human size string ("10GB", "500MB"). Empty or unparseable falls back to the default (10 GB). |
| `worktree_rig_error_size` | string |  | `50GB` | WorktreeRigErrorSize is the per-rig error threshold. When any rig exceeds this, the worktree-disk-size check reports an error rather than a warning. Empty or unparseable falls back to the default (50 GB). |
| `nested_worktree_prune` | boolean |  | `false` | NestedWorktreePrune escalates the nested-worktree-prune check from warning to error severity when safely-prunable nested worktrees are present, so CI / scripted doctor runs fail until the operator runs `gc doctor --fix`. Actual removal still requires --fix; this flag does not auto-prune. Safety is enforced by mechanical checks (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits, no stashes) — never by role identity. |
| `check` | []LocalDoctorCheck |  |  | Checks holds city-local inline doctor checks declared via [[doctor.check]] in city.toml. |

## DoltConfig

DoltConfig holds optional dolt server overrides.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | integer |  | `0` | Port is the dolt server port. 0 means use ephemeral port allocation (hashed from city path). Set explicitly to override. |
| `host` | string |  | `localhost` | Host is the dolt server hostname. Defaults to localhost. |
| `archive_level` | integer |  | `0` | ArchiveLevel controls Dolt's auto_gc archive aggressiveness. 0 disables archive compaction (lower CPU on startup). 1 enables archive compaction (higher CPU on startup). nil (omitted) defaults to 0. |
| `auto_gc_enabled` | boolean |  | `true` | AutoGCEnabled toggles Dolt's incremental auto-GC on the managed sql-server. Auto-GC bounds the noms journal so it never reaches GB scale, which shrinks both the unclean-stop corruption window and the recovery blast radius. nil (omitted) defaults to true. |
| `max_connections` | integer |  | `256` | MaxConnections overrides the managed Dolt listener max_connections. 0 means use the managed default. |
| `read_timeout_millis` | integer |  | `15000` | ReadTimeoutMillis overrides the managed Dolt listener read_timeout_millis. 0 means use the managed default. |
| `write_timeout_millis` | integer |  | `300000` | WriteTimeoutMillis overrides the managed Dolt listener write_timeout_millis. 0 means use the managed default. |
| `dolt_lock_release_timeout` | string |  | `1m` | DoltLockReleaseTimeout is how long managed-dolt lifecycle operations wait for dolt's on-disk exclusive store locks (the root-level `&lt;data_dir&gt;/.dolt/noms/LOCK` and per-database `&lt;data_dir&gt;/&lt;db&gt;/.dolt/noms/LOCK` forms) to be released by a prior server process before failing closed. The start path refuses to launch a second `dolt sql-server` against a data_dir whose lock is still held — a prior instance that is shutting down holds the lock until its chunk journal is flushed, and binding before release corrupts the journal (see gastownhall/gascity#3174). The stop path uses the same window to wait for lock release after process exit before reporting success. Duration string (e.g., "1m", "90s"). Defaults to "1m", which covers the flush window of multi-GB journals on commodity SSDs. Set to "0s" to probe once with no wait (still fail-closed when held). Negative values are rejected at config load. The managed lifecycle also projects this value into the gc-beads-bd.sh shell fallback as GC_DOLT_LOCK_RELEASE_TIMEOUT_MS (milliseconds), so both paths honor the configured window. |

## DoltMaintenance

DoltMaintenance configures the periodic Dolt store maintenance loop.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean |  |  | Enabled toggles the maintenance loop. Defaults to false (opt-in). |
| `interval` | string |  | `168h` | Interval is the cadence between maintenance runs as a duration string (e.g., "168h"). Defaults to 168h (weekly). |
| `alert_to` | string |  |  | AlertTo is the agent identity to mail on failure (e.g., "gascity/mayor"). Empty disables alert mail. |
| `gc_timeout` | string |  | `10m` | GCTimeout is the ceiling for CALL DOLT_GC() as a duration string. Defaults to 10m. |

## EventsConfig

EventsConfig holds events provider settings.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider selects the events backend: "fake", "fail", "exec:&lt;script&gt;", or "" (default: file-backed JSONL). |
| `rotation` | EventsRotationConfig |  |  | Rotation configures file-backed JSONL rotation. Defaults are applied by EventsRotationConfig helper methods when this table is absent. |

## EventsRotationConfig

EventsRotationConfig holds file-backed events rotation settings.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean |  | `true` | Enabled controls automatic size-triggered rotation. Defaults to true. |
| `max_size_bytes` | integer |  | `268435456` | MaxSizeBytes is the active events.jsonl size threshold. Defaults to DefaultEventsRotationMaxSizeBytes. |
| `check_interval_records` | integer |  | `1024` | CheckIntervalRecords is the number of records between size checks. Defaults to DefaultEventsRotationCheckIntervalRecords. |
| `check_interval_seconds` | integer |  | `60` | CheckIntervalSeconds is the time backstop between size checks. Defaults to DefaultEventsRotationCheckIntervalSeconds. |
| `archive_retain_age` | string |  |  | ArchiveRetainAge is an optional Go duration. Empty keeps all archives. |

## ExtMsgConfig

ExtMsgConfig configures the external-messaging fabric.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `default_route` | []ExtMsgDefaultRoute |  |  | DefaultRoutes map inbound conversations that have no binding and no group route to a configured agent, keyed by provider and optionally narrowed to one adapter account. The first matching inbound message binds the conversation to the agent (an agent-name binding), so the route is sticky until rebound or unbound. |

## ExtMsgDefaultRoute

ExtMsgDefaultRoute routes unbound inbound conversations from one external messaging provider (and optionally a single adapter account) to a configured agent.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string | **yes** |  | Provider is the external messaging provider name as registered by the adapter (e.g. "telegram"). Required. |
| `account_id` | string |  |  | AccountID narrows the route to one adapter account. Empty matches every account of the provider that has no account-specific route. |
| `agent` | string | **yes** |  | Agent is the configured agent identity to route to. It must resolve to a configured named session so the delivery layer can cold-wake a session for it. |

## FormulasConfig

FormulasConfig is the legacy [formulas] table with no supported fields: authored [formulas].dir is rejected at config load (use the well-known formulas/ directory instead), and gc doctor flags any declaration as a fixable v2-formulas-dir error.

## GitHubConfig

GitHubConfig groups GitHub-facing repository monitor declarations.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `pr_monitor` | []GitHubPRMonitor |  |  | PRMonitors declares GitHub pull-request readiness monitors. |

| `repair_route` | string | **yes** |  | RepairRoute is the operator-supplied route target for repair work. |
| `repair_workflow` | string |  |  | RepairWorkflow is the formula attached to repair beads created for this monitor. Empty defaults to the standard polecat repair workflow so routed repair work carries the branch/test/push/refinery steps instead of sitting as a raw routed task. |
| `webhook_secret_env` | string |  |  | WebhookSecretEnv is the environment variable containing the webhook HMAC secret. The secret value itself must not be stored in city.toml. |
| `webhook_secret_key` | string |  |  | WebhookSecretKey is an optional stable key for identifying the webhook secret during rotation. When omitted, WebhookSecretEnv is the key. |
| `poll_interval` | string |  |  | PollInterval optionally enables bounded polling/backfill cadence. |

## LocalDoctorCheck

LocalDoctorCheck is a city-local doctor check declared inline in city.toml via [[doctor.check]].

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|

## MaintenanceConfig

MaintenanceConfig groups periodic store-maintenance subsections.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `dolt` | DoltMaintenance |  |  | Dolt configures the weekly Dolt store maintenance loop (CALL DOLT_GC + backup snapshot). |

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string | **yes** |  | Provider is the LLM provider label (e.g. "claude", "codex", "gemini"). |

| `last_verified` | string | **yes** |  | LastVerified is the date these rates were confirmed (YYYY-MM-DD). |

## NamedSession

NamedSession defines a canonical persistent session backed by an agent template.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string |  |  | Name is the configured public session identity. When omitted, Template remains the compatibility identity. |
| `template` | string | **yes** |  | Template is the referenced agent template name. Root declarations may target imported agents via "binding.agent". |
| `scope` | string |  |  | Scope defines where this named session is instantiated in pack expansion: "city" (one per city) or "rig" (one per rig). Omit the field for an unscoped session instantiated in both city and rig expansion contexts. Enum: `city`, `rig` |
| `dir` | string |  |  | Dir is the identity prefix for rig-scoped named sessions after pack expansion. Empty means city-scoped. |
| `mode` | string |  |  | Mode controls when the controller ensures this named session is live. "on_demand" (default): reserve identity and materialize when work or an explicit reference requires it. "always": keep the canonical session controller-managed. Note: mode="always" is independent of min_active_sessions; both produce sessions, and gc doctor reports accidental duplicate-pool combinations. Enum: `on_demand`, `always` |

## NamedSessionPatch

NamedSessionPatch modifies an existing named session identified by canonical name or, for compatibility, by an unambiguous template.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `dir` | string |  |  | Dir is the targeting key. Empty targets a city-scoped named session. |
| `name` | string |  |  | Name is the canonical named-session identity. Use this to disambiguate sessions that share the same template. |
| `template` | string |  |  | Template is a compatibility targeting key when Name is omitted. |
| `mode` | string |  |  | Mode overrides the named-session controller mode ("on_demand" or "always"). Enum: `on_demand`, `always` |

## OptionChoice

OptionChoice is one allowed value for a "select" option.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `value` | string | **yes** |  | Value is the choice identifier matched against ProviderOption.Default and the user's selection (e.g. "opus-4.8"). |
| `label` | string | **yes** |  | Label is the human-readable choice name shown in tooling. |
| `flag_args` | []string | **yes** |  | FlagArgs are the CLI arguments injected when this choice is selected. json:"-" is intentional: FlagArgs must never appear in the public API DTO (security boundary — prevents clients from seeing internal CLI flags). |
| `flag_aliases` | []array |  |  | FlagAliases are equivalent CLI argument sequences stripped from legacy provider args. Like FlagArgs, they stay server-side only. |

## OrderOverride

OrderOverride modifies a scanned order's scheduling fields and exec env.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the order name to target (required). |
| `rig` | string |  |  | Rig scopes the override to a specific rig's order. Empty matches city-level orders. |
| `enabled` | boolean |  |  | Enabled overrides whether the order is active. |
| `trigger` | string |  |  | Trigger overrides the trigger type. |
| `gate` | string |  |  | Gate is a deprecated alias for Trigger accepted during the gate-&gt;trigger migration. Parsed inputs are normalized to Trigger. |
| `interval` | string |  |  | Interval overrides the cooldown interval. Go duration string. |
| `schedule` | string |  |  | Schedule overrides the cron expression. |
| `check` | string |  |  | Check overrides the condition trigger check command. |
| `on` | string |  |  | On overrides the event trigger event type. |
| `pool` | string |  |  | Pool overrides the target session config. |
| `timeout` | string |  |  | Timeout overrides the per-order timeout. Go duration string. |
| `idempotent` | boolean |  |  | Idempotent overrides whether the order's dispatch is safe to repeat. Idempotent orders fail open when the open-work gate times out (#2893). |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env adds or overrides environment variables exported into an exec order's child process. |

## OrdersConfig

OrdersConfig holds order settings for orders discovered from flat TOML files (one file per order) in the orders/ directory beside each formula layer (packs, the city directory, and rig-local layers).

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `skip` | []string |  |  | Skip lists order names to exclude from scanning. |
| `max_timeout` | string |  |  | MaxTimeout is an operator hard cap on per-order timeouts. No order gets more than this duration. Go duration string (e.g., "60s"). Empty means uncapped (no override). |
| `overrides` | []OrderOverride |  |  | Overrides apply per-order field overrides after scanning. Each override targets an order by name and optionally by rig. |

## PackDefaults

PackDefaults holds [defaults] entries used to seed generated rig configuration.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `rig` | PackRigDefaults |  |  |  |

## PackRigDefaults

PackRigDefaults holds the [defaults.rig] block — defaults applied to rigs created from this pack.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `imports` | map[string]Import |  |  |  |

## Patches

Patches holds all patch blocks from composition.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `agent` | []AgentPatch |  |  | Agents targets agents by (dir, name). |
| `named_session` | []NamedSessionPatch |  |  | NamedSessions targets configured named sessions by (dir, template). |
| `rigs` | []RigPatch |  |  | Rigs targets rigs by name. |
| `providers` | []ProviderPatch |  |  | Providers targets providers by name. |
| `github_pr_monitor` | []GitHubPRMonitorPatch |  |  | GitHubPRMonitors targets GitHub PR readiness monitors by name. |

## PoolOverride

PoolOverride modifies legacy [pool] fields that map to session scaling.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `min` | integer |  |  | Min overrides the minimum number of sessions. |
| `max` | integer |  |  | Max overrides the maximum number of sessions. 0 means no sessions can claim routed work. |
| `check` | string |  |  | Check overrides the session scale check command template. Supports the same Go template placeholders as Agent.scale_check. |
| `drain_timeout` | string |  |  | DrainTimeout overrides the drain timeout. Duration string (e.g., "5m", "30m", "1h"). |
| `on_death` | string |  |  | OnDeath overrides the on_death command template. Supports the same Go template placeholders as Agent.on_death. |
| `on_boot` | string |  |  | OnBoot overrides the on_boot command template. Supports the same Go template placeholders as Agent.on_boot. |

## ProviderOption

ProviderOption declares a single configurable option for a provider.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `key` | string | **yes** |  | Key is the option identifier (e.g. "model"); also the merge key for options_schema_merge = "by_key". |
| `label` | string | **yes** |  | Label is the human-readable option name shown in tooling. |
| `type` | string | **yes** |  | "select" only (v1) |
| `default` | string | **yes** |  | Default is the Value of the choice selected when the user makes none. |
| `choices` | []OptionChoice | **yes** |  | Choices are the allowed values; selecting one injects its FlagArgs into the agent command line (how the Model axis renders to a harness CLI flag). |
| `omit` | boolean |  |  | Omit is the removal sentinel for options_schema_merge = "by_key". When set on a child layer's entry, the matching Key inherited from a parent layer is pruned from the resolved schema. |

## ProviderPatch

ProviderPatch modifies an existing provider identified by Name.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the targeting key (required). Must match an existing provider's name. |
| `base` | string |  |  | Base overrides the provider's inheritance parent (presence-aware). Pointer to a pointer so the patch can distinguish "no change" (double-nil) from "clear to inherit default" (single-nil value in outer pointer) from "set to explicit empty opt-out" (value "" in inner pointer) from "set to &lt;name&gt;". Callers use:   nil          = patch does not touch Base   &(*string)(nil) = patch clears Base to absent   &(&"")       = patch sets Base = "" (explicit opt-out)   &(&"builtin:codex") = patch sets Base to that value |
| `command` | string |  |  | Command overrides the provider command. |
| `acp_command` | string |  |  | ACPCommand overrides the provider command for ACP transport sessions. |
| `args` | []string |  |  | Args overrides the provider args. |
| `acp_args` | []string |  |  | ACPArgs overrides the provider args for ACP transport sessions. |
| `args_append` | []string |  |  | ArgsAppend overrides the provider args_append list. |
| `options_schema_merge` | string |  |  | OptionsSchemaMerge overrides the options_schema merge mode. |
| `prompt_mode` | string |  |  | PromptMode overrides prompt delivery mode. Enum: `arg`, `flag`, `none` |
| `prompt_flag` | string |  |  | PromptFlag overrides the prompt flag. |
| `ready_delay_ms` | integer |  |  | ReadyDelayMs overrides the ready delay in milliseconds. |
| `accept_startup_dialogs` | boolean |  |  | AcceptStartupDialogs overrides startup dialog acceptance behavior. |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env adds or overrides environment variables. |
| `env_remove` | []string |  |  | EnvRemove lists env var keys to remove. |
| `_replace` | boolean |  |  | Replace replaces the entire provider block instead of deep-merging. |

## ProviderSpec

ProviderSpec defines a named provider's startup parameters.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `base` | string |  |  | Base names the parent provider this spec inherits from. Supported forms:   "&lt;name&gt;"          - custom first (self-excluded), then built-in   "builtin:&lt;name&gt;"  - force built-in lookup   "provider:&lt;name&gt;" - force custom lookup   ""                - explicit standalone opt-out   nil               - field absent; no explicit declaration |
| `args_append` | []string |  |  | ArgsAppend accumulates extra args after each layer's Args replacement. |
| `options_schema_merge` | string |  |  | OptionsSchemaMerge controls OptionsSchema merge mode across the chain: "replace" (default) or "by_key". Enum: `replace`, `by_key` |
| `display_name` | string |  |  | DisplayName is the human-readable name shown in UI and logs. |
| `command` | string |  |  | Command is the executable to run for this provider. |
| `args` | []string |  |  | Args are default command-line arguments passed to the provider. The built-in Kiro provider defaults to ["chat", "--no-interactive", "--agent", "gascity", "--trust-all-tools"]; remove or replace "--trust-all-tools" by defining [providers.kiro].args explicitly in city.toml. |
| `prompt_mode` | string |  | `arg` | PromptMode controls how prompts are delivered: "arg", "flag", or "none". Enum: `arg`, `flag`, `none` |
| `prompt_flag` | string |  |  | PromptFlag is the CLI flag used when prompt_mode is "flag" (e.g. "--prompt"). |
| `ready_delay_ms` | integer |  |  | ReadyDelayMs is milliseconds to wait after launch before the provider is considered ready. |
| `ready_prompt_prefix` | string |  |  | ReadyPromptPrefix is the string prefix that indicates the provider is ready for input. |
| `process_names` | []string |  |  | ProcessNames lists process names to look for when checking if the provider is running. |
| `emits_permission_warning` | boolean |  |  | EmitsPermissionWarning is tri-state: nil = inherit, &true = enable, &false = explicit disable. |
| `accept_startup_dialogs` | boolean |  |  | AcceptStartupDialogs is tri-state: nil = default startup dialog handling, &true = force dialog acceptance, &false = suppress it for providers that handle permissions entirely through launch flags. |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env sets additional environment variables for the provider process. |
| `path_check` | string |  |  | PathCheck overrides the binary name used for PATH detection. When set, lookupProvider and detectProviderName use this instead of Command for exec.LookPath checks. Useful when Command is a shell wrapper (e.g. sh -c '...') but we need to verify the real binary is installed. |
| `supports_acp` | boolean |  |  | SupportsACP indicates the binary speaks the Agent Client Protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio). When an agent sets session = "acp", its resolved provider must have SupportsACP = true. |
| `supports_hooks` | boolean |  |  | SupportsHooks indicates the provider has an executable hook mechanism (settings.json, plugins, etc.) for lifecycle events. |
| `instructions_file` | string |  |  | InstructionsFile is the filename the provider reads for project instructions (e.g., "CLAUDE.md", "AGENTS.md"). Empty defaults to "AGENTS.md". |
| `resume_flag` | string |  |  | ResumeFlag is the CLI flag for resuming a session by ID. Empty means the provider does not support resume. Examples: "--resume" (claude), "resume" (codex) |
| `resume_style` | string |  |  | ResumeStyle controls how ResumeFlag is applied:   "flag"       → command --resume &lt;key&gt;              (default)   "subcommand" → command resume &lt;key&gt; |
| `resume_command` | string |  |  | ResumeCommand is the full shell command to run when resuming a session. Supports only the &#123;&#123;.SessionKey&#125;&#125; template variable. When set, takes precedence over ResumeFlag/ResumeStyle. When schema-managed defaults are inserted, the resolver tokenizes and re-emits the command; for subcommand-style resume it inserts after the ResumeFlag token that precedes &#123;&#123;.SessionKey&#125;&#125;. Example:   "claude --resume &#123;&#123;.SessionKey&#125;&#125; --dangerously-skip-permissions" Schema-managed defaults missing from a subcommand-style resume command are inserted before &#123;&#123;.SessionKey&#125;&#125; during provider resolution. |
| `session_id_flag` | string |  |  | SessionIDFlag is the CLI flag for providers that support creating a fresh session with a caller-supplied ID. Empty means fresh starts cannot receive a preselected provider session ID; resume metadata must come from the provider after startup. |
| `fork_flag` | string |  |  | ForkFlag is the CLI flag that forks a resumed conversation into a new branch (claude's "--fork-session"). With ResumeFlag + SessionIDFlag it forms the fork-launch command (resume a parent brain session, fork off it, bind gc's own session id). Empty means the provider has no fork verb, in which case a launch carrying a parent sid fails loud rather than silently degrading to a fresh session. |
| `permission_modes` | map[string]string |  |  | PermissionModes maps permission mode names to CLI flags. Example: &#123;"unrestricted": "--dangerously-skip-permissions", "plan": "--permission-mode plan"&#125; This is a config-only lookup table consumed by external clients (e.g., real-world app) to populate permission mode dropdowns. Launch-time flag substitution is planned for a follow-up PR — currently no runtime code reads this field. |
| `option_defaults` | map[string]string |  |  | OptionDefaults overrides the Default value in OptionsSchema entries without redefining the schema itself. Keys are option keys (e.g., "permission_mode"), values are choice values (e.g., "unrestricted"). city.toml users set this to customize provider behavior without touching Args or OptionsSchema. |
| `options_schema` | []ProviderOption |  |  | OptionsSchema declares the configurable options this provider supports. Each option maps to CLI args via its Choices[].FlagArgs field. Serialized via a dedicated DTO (not directly to JSON) so FlagArgs stays server-side. |
| `upstream_env` | UpstreamEnvBinding |  |  | UpstreamEnv is this harness's serving-env contract (Phase C — the Upstream axis): the env-var NAMES this CLI reads for the model-serving base URL and credential. It lets the resolver render an abstract [upstreams.&lt;name&gt;] onto the right names for this harness, so an upstream preset is portable across harnesses (claude → ANTHROPIC_*, codex → OPENAI_*). |
| `print_args` | []string |  |  | PrintArgs are CLI arguments that enable one-shot non-interactive mode. The provider prints its response to stdout and exits. When empty, the provider does not support one-shot invocation. Examples: ["-p"] (claude, gemini), ["exec"] (codex), ["--quiet", "--prompt"] (kimi) |
| `title_model` | string |  |  | TitleModel is the OptionsSchema model key used for title generation. Resolved via the "model" option in OptionsSchema to get FlagArgs. Defaults to the cheapest/fastest model for each provider. Examples: "haiku" (claude), "o4-mini" (codex), "gemini-2.5-flash" (gemini) |
| `acp_command` | string |  |  | ACPCommand overrides Command when the session transport is ACP. When empty, Command is used for both tmux and ACP transports. |
| `acp_args` | []string |  |  | ACPArgs overrides Args when the session transport is ACP. When nil, Args is used for both tmux and ACP transports. |

## Rig

Rig defines an external project registered in the city.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the unique identifier for this rig. |
| `path` | string |  |  | Path is the absolute filesystem path to the rig's repository. |
| `prefix` | string |  |  | Prefix overrides the auto-derived bead ID prefix for this rig. |
| `default_branch` | string |  |  | DefaultBranch is the rig repository's mainline branch (e.g. "main", "master", "develop"). When set, routing formulas use this as the default merge target instead of probing origin/HEAD at sling time. Captured by `gc rig add` from the rig's git config; set manually for rigs whose mainline isn't reachable via origin/HEAD. |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended is the deprecated pre-runtime-state suspension flag. Parsed for backwards compatibility and treated as an alias for SuspendedOnStart by [Rig.EffectiveSuspendedOnStart], so existing cities with `suspended = true` continue to start their rigs suspended after upgrade. Live suspend/resume commands no longer write this field. `gc doctor` flags it and offers `--fix` to rename to suspended_on_start. |
| `suspended_on_start` | boolean |  |  | SuspendedOnStart is the rig's desired suspension state at city start. When true and no explicit entry exists for this rig in .gc/runtime/suspension-state.json, the rig is treated as suspended. Once the user has explicitly suspended or resumed the rig via `gc rig suspend/resume`, the runtime state wins. |
| `formulas_dir` | string |  |  | FormulasDir is a rig-local formula directory — the highest-priority formula layer, above city pack formulas, the city formulas/ directory, and rig pack formulas. Overrides pack formulas for this rig by filename. Relative paths resolve against the city directory. |
| `includes` | []string |  |  | Includes lists pack directories or URLs for this rig (V1 mechanism). Each entry is a local path, a git source//sub#ref URL, or a GitHub tree URL. |
| `imports` | map[string]Import |  |  | Imports defines named pack imports for this rig (V2 mechanism). Each key is a binding name; agents from these imports get qualified names like "rigName/bindingName.agentName". |
| `max_active_sessions` | integer |  |  | MaxActiveSessions is the rig-level cap on total concurrent sessions across all agents in this rig. Nil means inherit from workspace (or unlimited). |
| `overrides` | []AgentOverride |  |  | Overrides are per-agent patches applied after pack expansion. V2 renames this to "patches" for consistency with [[patches.agent]]. Both TOML keys are accepted during migration. |
| `patches` | []AgentOverride |  |  | Patches is the V2 name for rig-level agent overrides. Takes precedence over Overrides if both are set. |
| `default_sling_target` | string |  |  | DefaultSlingTarget is the agent qualified name used when gc sling is invoked with only a bead ID (no explicit target). Resolved via resolveAgentIdentity. Example: "rig/polecat" |
| `session_sleep` | SessionSleepConfig |  |  | SessionSleep overrides workspace-level idle sleep defaults for agents in this rig. |
| `dolt_host` | string |  |  | DoltHost overrides the city-level Dolt host for this rig's beads. Use when the rig's database lives on a different Dolt server (e.g., shared from another city). |
| `dolt_port` | string |  |  | DoltPort overrides the city-level Dolt port for this rig's beads. When set, controller commands (scale_check, work_query) prefix their shell invocations with BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_PORT=&lt;port&gt; so bd connects to the correct server instead of the city-level default. |
| `formula_vars` | map[string]string |  |  | FormulaVars provides rig-scoped defaults for formula vars. Keys match var names declared in formula `[vars.&lt;name&gt;]` blocks. Values are used when a formula runs in this rig and the caller did not pass an explicit --var override. Takes precedence over formula-level defaults but loses to --var flags. |

## RigPatch

RigPatch modifies an existing rig identified by Name.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the targeting key (required). Must match an existing rig's name. |
| `path` | string |  |  | Path overrides the rig's filesystem path. |
| `prefix` | string |  |  | Prefix overrides the bead ID prefix. |
| `default_branch` | string |  |  | DefaultBranch overrides the rig's recorded mainline branch. |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended is the deprecated, pre-runtime-state suspension override. Parsed for backwards compatibility; `gc doctor` surfaces it as a warning and recommends the rename to SuspendedOnStart. No behavioral code path reads it. |
| `suspended_on_start` | boolean |  |  | SuspendedOnStart overrides the rig's desired suspension state at city start. Mirrors Rig.SuspendedOnStart. |
| `formula_vars` | map[string]string |  |  | FormulaVars adds or overrides rig-scoped formula var defaults. Additive merge: patch keys win over existing rig keys, unspecified keys are preserved. |

## Service

Service declares a workspace-owned HTTP service mounted under /svc/{name}.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the unique service identifier within a workspace. |
| `kind` | string |  |  | Kind selects how the service is implemented. Enum: `workflow`, `proxy_process` |
| `publish_mode` | string |  |  | PublishMode declares how the service is intended to be published. v0 supports private services and direct reuse of the API listener. Enum: `private`, `direct` |
| `state_root` | string |  |  | StateRoot overrides the managed service state root. Defaults to .gc/services/&#123;name&#125;. The path must stay within .gc/services/. |
| `publication` | ServicePublicationConfig |  |  | Publication declares generic publication intent. The platform decides whether and how that intent becomes a public route. |
| `workflow` | ServiceWorkflowConfig |  |  | Workflow configures controller-owned workflow services. |
| `process` | ServiceProcessConfig |  |  | Process configures controller-supervised proxy services. |

## ServiceProcessConfig

ServiceProcessConfig configures a controller-supervised local process that is reverse-proxied under /svc/{name}.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `command` | []string |  |  | Command is the argv used to start the local service process. |
| `health_path` | string |  |  | HealthPath, when set, is probed on the local listener before the service is marked ready. |

## ServicePublicationConfig

ServicePublicationConfig declares platform-neutral publication intent.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `visibility` | string |  |  | Visibility selects whether the service is private to the workspace, available publicly, or gated by tenant auth at the platform edge. Enum: `private`, `public`, `tenant` |
| `hostname` | string |  |  | Hostname overrides the default hostname label derived from service.name. |
| `allow_websockets` | boolean |  |  | AllowWebSockets permits websocket upgrades on the published route. |

## ServiceWorkflowConfig

ServiceWorkflowConfig configures controller-owned workflow services.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `contract` | string |  |  | Contract selects the built-in workflow handler. |

## SessionConfig

SessionConfig holds session provider settings.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider selects the session backend: "fake", "fail", "subprocess", "acp", "exec:&lt;script&gt;", "k8s", or "" (default: tmux). |
| `k8s` | K8sConfig |  |  | K8s holds Kubernetes-specific settings for the native K8s provider. |
| `acp` | ACPSessionConfig |  |  | ACP holds settings for the ACP (Agent Client Protocol) session provider. |
| `setup_timeout` | string |  | `10s` | SetupTimeout is the per-command/script timeout for session setup and pre_start commands. Duration string (e.g., "10s", "30s"). Defaults to "10s". |
| `nudge_ready_timeout` | string |  | `10s` | NudgeReadyTimeout is how long to wait for the agent to be ready before sending nudge text. Duration string. Defaults to "10s". |
| `nudge_retry_interval` | string |  | `500ms` | NudgeRetryInterval is the retry interval between nudge readiness polls. Duration string. Defaults to "500ms". |
| `nudge_lock_timeout` | string |  | `30s` | NudgeLockTimeout is how long to wait to acquire the per-session nudge lock. Duration string. Defaults to "30s". |
| `debounce_ms` | integer |  | `500` | DebounceMs is the default debounce interval in milliseconds for send-keys. Defaults to 500. |
| `display_ms` | integer |  | `5000` | DisplayMs is the default display duration in milliseconds for status messages. Defaults to 5000. |
| `startup_timeout` | string |  | `60s` | StartupTimeout is how long to wait for each agent's Start() call before treating it as failed. Duration string (e.g., "60s", "2m"). Defaults to "60s". |
| `progress_stall_timeout` | string |  |  | ProgressStallTimeout, when set, enables progress-aware session recycling: a desired, alive, claim-less session on a healthy provider whose last provider-reported activity is older than this duration is restarted fresh. Such a session has likely parked (e.g. its turn ended on a provider auth error) and will not self-recover. Set this above the longest legitimate alive-idle period for the city; values below 5m are clamped to 5m. Duration string (e.g. "30m"). Unset/zero disables it. |
| `socket` | string |  |  | Socket specifies the tmux socket name for per-city isolation. When set, all tmux commands use "tmux -L &lt;socket&gt;" to connect to a dedicated server. When empty, defaults to the city name (workspace.name) — giving every city its own tmux server automatically. Set explicitly to override. |
| `remote_match` | string |  |  | RemoteMatch is a substring pattern for the hybrid provider to route sessions to the remote (K8s) backend. Sessions whose names contain this pattern go to K8s; all others stay local (tmux). Overridden by the GC_HYBRID_REMOTE_MATCH env var if set. |

## SessionSleepConfig

SessionSleepConfig configures default idle sleep policies by session class.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `interactive_resume` | string |  |  | InteractiveResume applies to attachable sessions using wake_mode=resume. Accepts a duration string or "off". |
| `interactive_fresh` | string |  |  | InteractiveFresh applies to attachable sessions using wake_mode=fresh. Accepts a duration string or "off". |
| `noninteractive` | string |  |  | NonInteractive applies to sessions with attach=false. Accepts a duration string or "off". |

## Tier

| `completion_usd_per_1m` | number | **yes** |  |  |
| `cache_read_usd_per_1m` | number | **yes** |  |  |
| `cache_creation_usd_per_1m` | number | **yes** |  |  |

## UpstreamEnvBinding

UpstreamEnvBinding is a harness's serving-env contract: the env-var NAMES this CLI reads for the model-serving endpoint and credential.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `base_url` | string |  |  | BaseURL is the env var name the harness reads for the serving base URL. |
| `api_key` | string |  |  | APIKey is the env var name the harness reads for the API key. |
| `auth_token` | string |  |  | AuthToken is the env var name the harness reads for a bearer auth token. |

## UpstreamSpec

UpstreamSpec is a named model-serving endpoint preset (Phase C — the Upstream axis: WHO serves+resolves the model).

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `description` | string |  |  | Description is a human-readable summary shown in tooling. |
| `base_url` | string |  |  | BaseURL is the abstract serving endpoint, rendered onto the harness's base_url env var name (UpstreamEnvBinding.BaseURL). |
| `api_key` | string |  |  | APIKey is the abstract credential, rendered onto the harness's api_key env var name. May be a $VAR ref so the secret stays out of config. |
| `auth_token` | string |  |  | AuthToken is an abstract bearer-token credential (an alternative to APIKey for harnesses/upstreams that use a token), rendered onto the harness's auth_token env var name. |
| `base_url_env` | string |  |  | BaseURLEnv/APIKeyEnv/AuthTokenEnv override the HARNESS binding's env-var name for the corresponding abstract field. Needed for GATEWAY harnesses — one CLI (e.g. opencode) fronting many upstreams where the credential env var is upstream-dependent (GROQ_API_KEY, CEREBRAS_API_KEY, …), so the HARNESS has no single binding and the UPSTREAM names its own target. Precedence per field: this override &gt; the harness binding &gt; error. |
| `api_key_env` | string |  |  | APIKeyEnv overrides the harness binding's api_key env-var name for this upstream (see BaseURLEnv for when this is needed). |
| `auth_token_env` | string |  |  | AuthTokenEnv overrides the harness binding's auth_token env-var name for this upstream (see BaseURLEnv). |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env is a harness-specific escape hatch: raw env keys merged AFTER the abstract fields render. Values may use $VAR refs. |

## UsageConfig

UsageConfig holds usage-fact sink settings.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider selects the usage sink backend:   - "discard" / "fake" → drop all facts   - "exec:&lt;script&gt;" → user-supplied script (JSON fact per line on stdin)   - "" / "local" → durable file-backed JSONL at .gc/usage.jsonl (default) |

## Workspace

Workspace holds city-level metadata and optional defaults that apply to all agents unless overridden per-agent.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string |  |  | Name is the legacy checked-in city name. Runtime identity now resolves from site binding (.gc/site.toml workspace_name), declared config, and basename precedence instead; gc init writes the machine-local name to site.toml and omits it from city.toml. |
| `prefix` | string |  |  | Prefix overrides the auto-derived HQ bead ID prefix. When empty, the prefix is derived from the city Name via DeriveBeadsPrefix. |
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider is the default provider name used by agents that don't specify one. |
| `start_command` | string |  |  | StartCommand overrides the provider's command for all agents. |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended is the deprecated pre-runtime-state city suspension flag. Parsed for backwards compatibility and treated as an alias for SuspendedOnStart by [Workspace.EffectiveSuspendedOnStart], so existing cities with `suspended = true` continue to start suspended after upgrade. Live suspend/resume commands no longer write this field. `gc doctor` flags it and offers `--fix` to rename to suspended_on_start. |
| `suspended_on_start` | boolean |  |  | SuspendedOnStart is the city's desired suspension state at start. When true and no explicit entry exists in .gc/runtime/suspension-state.json, the city is treated as suspended. Once the user has explicitly suspended or resumed via `gc suspend/resume`, the runtime state wins. |
| `max_active_sessions` | integer |  |  | MaxActiveSessions is the workspace-level cap on total concurrent sessions. Nil means unlimited. Agents and rigs inherit this if they don't set their own. |
| `session_template` | string |  |  | SessionTemplate is a template string supporting placeholders: &#123;&#123;.City&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.Agent&#125;&#125; (sanitized), &#123;&#123;.Dir&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.Name&#125;&#125;. Controls tmux session naming. Default (empty): "&#123;&#123;.Agent&#125;&#125;" — just the sanitized agent name. Per-city tmux socket isolation makes a city prefix unnecessary. |
| `install_agent_hooks` | []string |  |  | InstallAgentHooks lists provider names whose hooks should be installed into agent working directories. Agent-level overrides workspace-level (replace, not additive). Supported: "claude", "codex", "gemini", "antigravity", "kiro", "opencode", "mimocode", "groq", "cerebras", "copilot", "cursor", "pi", "omp", "kimi". |
| `global_fragments` | []string |  |  | GlobalFragments lists named template fragments injected into every agent's rendered prompt. Applied before per-agent InjectFragments. Each name must match a &#123;&#123; define "name" &#125;&#125; block from a pack's prompts/shared/ directory. |
| `includes` | []string |  |  | Includes is the legacy city.toml pack-composition list.  Deprecated: use root pack.toml [imports.*] instead. Run gc doctor to inspect; gc doctor --fix handles the safe mechanical rewrites available in this release wave. Each entry is a local path, a git source//sub#ref URL, or a GitHub tree URL. |
| `default_rig_includes` | []string |  |  | DefaultRigIncludes is the legacy city.toml default-rig pack list.  Deprecated: use city.toml [defaults.rig.imports.&lt;binding&gt;] instead. Run gc doctor to inspect; gc doctor --fix handles the safe mechanical rewrites available in this release wave. |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env defines workspace-wide environment variables applied to every managed session. Lowest config-precedence — overridden by provider, agent, and patch env. Use for cross-cutting variables like GC_TARGET_BRANCH that every agent should inherit. |
