## Read These First

- [Codebase Map](codebase-map.md)
- [Docs Organization](docs-organization.md) when adding or moving pages in
  the published `docs/` tree
- [Architecture Overview](../architecture/index.md)
- [Primitive Test](primitive-test.md)
- [PR Review Handoff Notes](pr-review-handoff.md)
- [Reconciler Debugging](reconciler-debugging.md)
- [Huma Usage Notes](huma-usage.md) when touching `internal/api/`,
  OpenAPI generation, or SSE registration
- [Excalidraw Setup](excalidraw-setup.md) when authoring diagrams for the docs
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [`TESTING.md`](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/blob/main/TESTING.md)

## Expectations

- Keep current-state behavior in the architecture docs and future changes in
  the design docs.
- Treat the [Primitive Test](primitive-test.md) as the gate before adding new
  SDK surface area.
- Run `make check` before you open a PR.
- Run `make check-docs` when changing navigation, cross-links, or docs
  structure.

## When to Update Docs

- Update architecture docs when code behavior changes.
- Update design-doc status when a proposal is accepted, implemented, or
  superseded.
- Move exploratory notes, audits, and roadmaps into the archive instead of
  presenting them as current onboarding material.
