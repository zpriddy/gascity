title: "The Primitive Test"
---

Decision framework for whether a capability belongs in Gas City's SDK
primitive layer or in the consumer layer (agent prompts, `bd` CLI, user
config, external binaries).

## The three necessary conditions

A capability belongs in the SDK **only if all three hold.** If any
condition fails, it belongs in the consumer layer.

### 1. Atomicity — can agents do it safely without races?

If two agents calling CLI commands concurrently can corrupt state or
violate invariants, the SDK must provide the atomic version. If it's a
single-agent operation, naturally idempotent, or the underlying tool
already handles concurrency (e.g., SQL transactions, INSERT IGNORE),
agents can call it directly.

**Questions to ask:**
- Can two agents hit this operation simultaneously?
- Does the underlying tool (bd, git, tmux) already provide atomicity?
- Is there a read-check-write pattern that could race?

**Examples:**
- `bd label add` → INSERT IGNORE deduplicates → safe → consumer layer
- `bd slot clear` → idempotent set-to-empty → safe → consumer layer
- `bd slot set hook` → read-check-write race → fix in beads, not Gas City
- Two agents hooking the same bead → needs atomic CAS → Gas City's
  `beads.Store.Claim()` provides this when the underlying store doesn't

### 2. Does it become MORE useful as models improve?

If a smarter model would do it better from the prompt, this condition
fails and the capability belongs in the consumer layer. A primitive must
become MORE useful as models improve, not less. If it's pure plumbing
that models will always delegate to (and never improve upon), it's a
primitive.

**The test:** Imagine a model 10x more capable. Does this capability
become less necessary (→ consumer layer) or exactly as necessary
(→ primitive)?

**Examples:**
- "Decide whether to unhook a stale bead" → judgment → consumer layer
  (smarter model decides better)
- "Atomically transition bead status" → plumbing → primitive
  (smarter model still needs this)
- "Detect which agent should handle a task" → judgment → consumer layer
- "Create a git worktree" → plumbing → primitive
- "`gc done` command" → encodes judgment about when/how to finish →
  consumer layer (the agent decides its own done flow)

### 3. Is it transport or cognition?

If implementing it in Go requires a judgment call (`if stuck then X`),
it's cognition and belongs in the prompt — keep judgment out of Go; the
framework moves work, it doesn't reason. If it's pure data movement,
process management, or filesystem operations, it's transport and belongs
in the SDK.

**The test:** Does any line of Go contain a judgment call? If yes, the
decision belongs in the prompt, not the code.

**Examples:**
- "Query all beads where status=hooked" → transport → primitive
- "Decide recovery strategy for crashed agent" → cognition → consumer
- "Remove a git worktree" → transport → primitive
- "Detect stale hooks and decide what to do" → cognition → consumer
- "Send SIGTERM to a process" → transport → primitive

## Applying the framework

### Decision table template

| Capability | Atomicity needed? | More useful as models improve? | Transport, not cognition? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | Does the underlying tool race? | Does a smarter model still need this? | Is it pure transport? | All three → primitive |

### Common verdicts

**Primitive (all three pass):**
- Bead CRUD, hook with conflict detection
- Git worktree create/remove/list
- Session start/stop/attach
- Event append
- Config parse/validate

**Consumer layer (at least one fails):**
- Done flow orchestration (fails "more useful as models improve" — model decides)
- Stale hook recovery strategy (fails "transport, not cognition" — judgment)
- Bidirectional hook tracking (fails Atomicity — two `bd` calls suffice)
- Agent bead creation (fails Atomicity — `bd create` works)
- Label management (fails Atomicity — `bd label` is safe)

**Fix upstream (Atomicity problem in dependency):**
- `bd slot set hook` race → fix in beads, not Gas City

## The corollary: when to fix upstream vs wrap

If a capability fails the Primitive Test only because the underlying tool
has a concurrency bug, the right fix is in the tool — not a wrapper in
Gas City. Gas City wraps tools for ergonomics (consistent API), not to
paper over bugs.

**Fix upstream when:** The tool's own semantics should be atomic but aren't.
(Example: `bd slot set hook` should be atomic but has a read-check-write race.)

**Wrap in Gas City when:** The tool is correct but the SDK needs to compose
multiple tool calls atomically. (Example: create worktree + setup redirect
needs rollback if redirect fails.)
