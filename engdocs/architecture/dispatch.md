## Summary

Dispatch is Gas City's work routing mechanism -- a Layer 2-4 derived
mechanism that composes primitives (Session, Bead Store, Event Bus,
Config) to route work to agents. The `gc sling` command resolves a target
agent or pool, optionally instantiates a formula as a wisp, executes the
agent's sling query to route each bead, optionally wraps single beads in
a tracking convoy, records telemetry, and nudges the target. Convoys are
expanded to their open children before routing.

## Key Concepts

- **Sling**: The act of routing a bead to an agent or pool by executing
  the target's sling query. The sling query is a shell command template
  with `{}` as a placeholder for the bead ID. Implemented in
  `cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`.

- **Sling Query**: A shell command template on each agent config
  (`sling_query`) that routes a bead to that agent. Defaults to
  `bd update {} --assignee=<qualified-name>` for fixed agents and
  `bd update {} --label=pool:<qualified-name>` for pool agents. The `{}`
  placeholder is replaced with the actual bead ID at dispatch time.
  Defined in `internal/config/config.go:EffectiveSlingQuery`.

- **Container Expansion**: When a convoy is slung, dispatch expands it
  to its open children and routes each child individually. Non-open
  children are skipped. Epics are ordinary beads and are not expanded.
  The container itself becomes the convoy -- no auto-convoy is created.

- **Auto-Convoy**: When slinging a single bead (not a formula, not a
  container), dispatch automatically wraps it in a new convoy bead for
  batch tracking. Suppressed with `--no-convoy`.

- **Wisp Instantiation**: When `--formula` is set, dispatch creates an
  ephemeral molecule (wisp) from the named formula via `Store.MolCook`
  and routes the wisp's root bead to the target. Variable substitution
  and custom titles are supported.

- **Target Resolution**: The 2-step resolution of agent names -- first
  literal match against qualified names, then contextual match using the
  current rig directory. Implemented in
  `cmd/gc/cmd_agent.go:resolveAgentIdentity`.

- **System Formula**: A formula embedded in the `gc` binary that is
  materialized to `.gc/system-formulas/` at startup. System formulas
  are always overwritten to stay in sync with the binary version. Stale
  files are cleaned up. Implemented in `cmd/gc/system_formulas.go`.

- **Review Quorum Formula**: `mol-review-quorum` is a core pack
  compiler-v2 formula that dispatches exactly two read-only reviewer
  lanes using formula-supplied lane IDs, providers, models, and targets,
  and then routes a synthesis step. Dispatch treats it like any other
  formula-backed wisp; it does not give
  `dx-review` lifecycle ownership.

## Architecture

Dispatch is not a separate Go package. It is a composition of primitives
orchestrated by `cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`. The dispatch pipeline has three
layers:

```
CLI layer (cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go)
  |
  +-- cmdSling()          resolve city, config, agent, store
  |     |
  |     v
  +-- doSlingBatch()      container expansion (convoy -> children)
        |
        +-- doSling()     single-bead dispatch pipeline:
              |
              +-- instantiateWisp()     [if --formula] MolCook
              +-- checkBeadState()      [pre-flight] warn re-route
              +-- buildSlingCommand()   {} -> bead ID substitution
              +-- runner(slingCmd)      execute shell command
              +-- telemetry.RecordSling()
              +-- store.SetMetadata()   [if --merge] merge strategy
              +-- store.Create(convoy)  [if auto-convoy] tracking wrapper
              +-- doSlingNudge()        [if --nudge] wake the agent
```

### Data Flow

**Single bead dispatch** (`gc sling <agent> <bead-id>`):

1. `cmdSling` resolves the city path, loads config, and resolves the
   target agent via `resolveAgentIdentity`.
2. `doSlingBatch` checks if the bead is a container type. If not, falls
   through to `doSling`.
3. `doSling` warns about suspended agents or empty pools (unless
   `--force`).
4. If `--formula`, calls `instantiateWisp` which delegates to
   `Store.MolCook` to create the wisp and uses the root bead ID.
5. Pre-flight: warns if the bead already has an assignee or pool labels
   (unless `--force`).
6. Builds the sling command by replacing `{}` in the agent's
   `EffectiveSlingQuery()` with the bead ID.
7. Executes the sling command via `SlingRunner` (shell `sh -c`).
8. Records telemetry via `telemetry.RecordSling`.
9. If `--merge` is set, writes the merge strategy as bead metadata.
10. If auto-convoy is enabled (not `--no-convoy`, not `--formula`),
    creates a convoy bead and sets the routed bead's ParentID to the
    convoy.
11. If `--nudge`, sends a nudge to the target agent.

**Container expansion** (`gc sling <agent> <convoy-id>`):

1. `doSlingBatch` looks up the bead and checks `IsContainerType`.
2. Lists all children via `querier.Children`.
3. Partitions children into open (routable) and skipped (non-open).
4. Routes each open child individually through `buildSlingCommand` +
   `runner`. No auto-convoy is created -- the container IS the convoy.
5. Reports per-child success/failure and a summary line.
6. Nudges once after all children are routed (if `--nudge` and at
   least one succeeded).

### Key Types

- **`SlingOpts`** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`) -- All flags for the sling
  command: `IsFormula`, `DoNudge`, `Force`, `Title`, `Vars`, `Merge`,
  `NoConvoy`, `Owned`.

- **`SlingRunner`** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`) -- Function type
  `func(command string) (string, error)` that executes the sling shell
  command. Injectable for testing.

- **`BeadQuerier`** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`) -- Interface for retrieving
  a single bead by ID. Used for pre-flight checks.

- **`BeadChildQuerier`** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`) -- Extends `BeadQuerier`
  with `Children(parentID)` for container expansion.

- **`config.Agent`** (`internal/config/config.go`) -- Carries the
  `SlingQuery` field and `EffectiveSlingQuery()` method that determines
  how beads are routed to this agent.

## scale_check ↔ work_query correspondence

Dispatch has two read sides that must stay symmetric:

- **Reconciler (spawn side)**: when deciding whether a pool template
  needs another session, the controller invokes
  `Agent.EffectivePoolDemandQuery` (a thin pass-through that
  `EffectiveScaleCheck` also returns) and parses the count.
- **Worker (claim side)**: when an ephemeral session boots, `gc hook`
  invokes `Agent.EffectiveWorkQuery`, whose Tier 3 fires for unassigned
  routed work after the assignee tiers fall through.

Both forms answer the same question — "is there ready, unassigned,
non-epic work routed to this pool-demand target?" — and must therefore
observe the bead store through the same filters. They share target
resolution and predicates: `bdReadyPoolDemandShell(limitFlag)` reads the
canonical `gc.routed_to=<target>` route with `--include-ephemeral`, and
the temporary migration predicate reads `gc.run_target=<target>` only on
`gc.kind=workflow` roots that predate root `gc.routed_to` stamping. The
work-query form appends `--sort oldest --limit=1` to the canonical probe
and prints the first match, then filters the migration probe to roots with
empty `gc.routed_to`. That is an intentional routed-queue policy:
unassigned routed pool work is FIFO before priority, so newer
high-priority work does not jump ahead of older ready work already queued
for the same target. The count form unions canonical and migration
probes and deduplicates by bead ID before piping through `jq 'length'`.
Targets resolve to `Agent.PoolName` when set and
`Agent.QualifiedName()` otherwise, so pool instances and pool templates
land on the same routed queue.

Supported handoff forms are intentionally distinct. Generic pool demand is
ready work with `assignee=""` and `gc.routed_to=<target>`; assigning the
pool template itself is not pool demand. Direct named-session delivery is
ready work with `assignee=<named-session-identity>` and no generic route
metadata, so the reconciler does not also treat the handoff as generic pool
demand.

The shared predicate is the agreement substrate. Failure envelopes
intentionally differ: the worker path suppresses `bd ready` stderr and
returns `[]` so a session exits cleanly, while the count form propagates
the failure to `evaluatePool`, which records telemetry and falls back to
the pool minimum.

Diverging the two — for example, by adding a state filter to the
work-query without updating the count form — re-introduces the
protocol-mismatch class. Pre-PR #1516 symptom: the reconciler counted
molecule-typed beads as demand while the worker's `bd ready` skipped
them, so spawned sessions exited immediately and the reconciler
re-spawned, producing spawn storms.

PR #1516 retired the old molecule-counting tier from the count form. A
later gc-udx change added `--exclude-type=epic` to the worker claim
path, leaving the default count form one filter behind. This refactor
does two things: routes both paths through shared predicate helpers and
adds `--exclude-type=epic` to the default count form. During the
`gc.run_target` retirement window, `gc doctor --fix` backfills legacy
workflow roots and both shell predicates keep unbackfilled roots visible;
the controller's in-process demand readers share that same
workflow-root-only fallback. The fallback intentionally does not prefer
`gc.run_target` on child beads: current stampers write `gc.routed_to` for
routable children, and the migration audit found no open non-root bead with a
divergent `gc.routed_to` / `gc.run_target` pair. Custom `scale_check`
overrides are unchanged. Future predicate changes should be single-helper
changes; tests `TestPoolDemandPredicateSharedWithWorkQuery` (structural) and
`TestPoolDemandAndWorkQueryAgreeOnRoutedSemantics` (behavioral) guard against
regressions.

## Invariants

1. **Sling query placeholder is always `{}`.** The `buildSlingCommand`
   function performs literal string replacement of all `{}` occurrences
   with the bead ID. No other placeholder syntax is supported.

2. **Container expansion routes only open children.** Children with
   status other than `"open"` are skipped and reported, never routed.

3. **Auto-convoy is suppressed for formulas and containers.** When
   `--formula` is set or the target bead is a container type, no
   auto-convoy is created. Formulas have their own molecule structure;
   containers are their own convoy.

4. **`--owned` requires a convoy.** The `--owned` and `--no-convoy`
   flags are mutually exclusive. The CLI rejects the combination before
   dispatch begins.

5. **Merge strategy is one of three values.** `--merge` accepts only
   `"direct"`, `"mr"`, or `"local"`. The CLI validates before dispatch.

6. **Pre-flight warnings are best-effort.** If the bead store query
   fails, dispatch proceeds silently. Warnings never block routing.

7. **Telemetry records every dispatch attempt.** `RecordSling` is called
   on both success and failure paths with the target name, target type
   (`"agent"` or `"pool"`), method (`"bead"`, `"formula"`, or `"batch"`),
   and error status.

8. **Pool nudge targets the first running instance.** When nudging a
   pool, dispatch iterates pool instances in order and nudges the first
   one with a running session. If none are running, a warning is emitted.

9. **System formulas are idempotent.** `MaterializeSystemFormulas`
   always overwrites files to match the binary version and removes stale
   formula files that are no longer embedded. Non-formula files in the
   directory are left alone.

10. **Default sling queries differ by agent type.** Fixed agents default
    to `bd update {} --assignee=<name>`; pool agents default to
    `bd update {} --label=pool:<name>`. Custom `sling_query` overrides
    the default entirely.

11. **scale_check ↔ work_query correspondence.** The reconciler's
    pool-demand-detection path (`Agent.EffectivePoolDemandQuery`, count
    form) and the worker's claim path (`Agent.EffectiveWorkQuery`, Tier
    3 first-row form) MUST derive their `bd ready --include-ephemeral
    --metadata-field gc.routed_to=<target> --unassigned --exclude-type=epic
    --json` canonical predicate from the same target-resolution helper and
    `bdReadyPoolDemandShell` helper in `internal/config/config.go`. The
    worker and reconciler must also share the temporary migration predicate
    for `gc.run_target=<target>` on `gc.kind=workflow` roots with empty
    `gc.routed_to`; only the worker's first-row form adds native
    `bd ready --sort oldest --limit=1` selection to the canonical probe.
    Any pool-demand predicate change to one (added filter, modified target
    resolution, new state) MUST be reflected in the other. Diverging the two
    re-introduces the protocol-mismatch class — the reconciler
    spawning sessions for work the worker can't claim, or the worker idle
    while new demand sits unspawned. The legacy `workflow-control` fallback is
    worker-only for pre-rename `control-dispatcher` graphs and intentionally
    lives outside the shared primary pool-demand predicate. Enforced by
    `TestPoolDemandPredicateSharedWithWorkQuery` and
    `TestPoolDemandAndWorkQueryAgreeOnRoutedSemantics` in
    `internal/config/config_test.go`. Historical context: PR #1516
    removed the old molecule-counting tier from the count form; a later
    gc-udx change added `--exclude-type=epic` to the worker path; this
    refactor adds that filter to the default count form and makes the
    equivalence structural rather than coincidental.

## Rig-local control-dispatcher fallback

Every graph.v2 workflow gets an auto-injected `gc.kind=workflow-finalize` sink
step (and any other `gc.kind` control steps) routed to the **control
dispatcher** by `graphroute.ControlDispatcherBinding`. For a rig-scoped
molecule that resolves the **rig-local** `<rig>/control-dispatcher` and pins the
control steps to its session. A rig-local dispatcher can decay silently: if its
runtime/process vanishes, the session reconciler puts it `asleep` with
`sleep_reason=runtime-missing`, and it can sit that way for weeks. Until then
every new molecule's finalize step is pinned to a session that never wakes, so
the molecule cannot reach CLOSED — and nothing surfaces the stall until a halt
exposes the orphaned step beads (gastownhall/gascity#3454).

`ControlDispatcherBinding` therefore falls back to the **city-level** dispatcher
when the rig-local one is unhealthy:

- **Detection contract.** The rig-local dispatcher is "unhealthy" when its
  session bead (selected by the `agent:<qualified>` label in the *city* store)
  projects `session.LifecycleDisplayReason == "runtime-missing"` — the durable,
  reconciler-written `sleep_reason`. Evaluated at **sling time only** (per
  molecule). This threshold was chosen over "ever bound" (too strict) and
  "alive in the last N seconds" (needs a runtime-liveness probe the routing
  layer does not have); `runtime-missing` is the exact observed decay state and
  is derivable from the store alone.
- **Plumbing.** Session beads are city-scoped while the routing store is
  rig-scoped and cannot see them, so detection is injected as
  `graphroute.Deps.ControlDispatcherRuntimeMissing` (mirroring
  `DirectSessionResolver`). The cmd layer (`cliGraphrouteDeps`) supplies a
  city-store-backed implementation (`controlDispatcherSessionRuntimeMissing`);
  `graphroute` stays a pure decorator. A nil checker disables the fallback.
- **Fallback target.** The city-level dispatcher, resolved by re-running the
  resolution with an **empty rig context**. The fallback fires only when (a)
  routing is rig-scoped, (b) the rig dispatcher is runtime-missing, and (c) the
  city dispatcher resolves to a *distinct* agent. Otherwise the original binding
  is kept (the decay stays localized rather than mis-routing). It applies to the
  whole control route, not just finalize: a dead rig dispatcher can serve none
  of the molecule's control beads.
- **Observability.** Each re-routed control step is stamped
  `gc.control_dispatcher_fallback=<rig-local>-><city>`
  (`beadmeta.ControlDispatcherFallbackMetadataKey`). Operators detect a decayed
  rig-local dispatcher with
  `bd list --has-metadata-key gc.control_dispatcher_fallback` instead of reading
  every workflow's finalize step — without this signal the fallback itself would
  become the new silent decay.

## Interactions

| Depends on | How |
|---|---|
| `internal/beads` (Store) | `MolCook` for wisp instantiation, `Create` for auto-convoy, `Get`/`Children` for container expansion, `Update` for ParentID linking, `SetMetadata` for merge strategy |
| `internal/config` | Agent resolution, `EffectiveSlingQuery`, pool detection via `IsPool`, `PoolConfig` for sizing, `Suspended` flag |
| `internal/runtime` | `Provider.IsRunning` and `Provider.Nudge` for agent nudging via `doSlingNudge` |
| `internal/agent` | `SessionNameFor` to compute session names |
| `internal/worker` | `Handle.Nudge` at the worker boundary for direct nudge delivery |
| `internal/telemetry` | `RecordSling` for metrics and log events on every dispatch |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_agent.go` | `resolveAgentIdentity` for 2-step target resolution (literal then contextual) |

| Depended on by | How |
|---|---|
| `cmd/gc/cmd_convoy.go` | Convoys are the batch tracking containers that dispatch creates and expands |
| `internal/orders` | Order dispatch creates wisps and routes them through the same formula instantiation path (`Store.MolCook`) |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_handoff.go` | Work handoff between agents uses similar agent resolution and bead routing patterns |
| Controller | The controller's reconciliation loop drives pool sizing via `evaluatePool` which determines how many pool instances exist to receive slung work |

## Configuration

The dispatch mechanism is configured through agent-level fields in
`city.toml`:

```toml
[[agent]]
name = "worker"

# Custom sling query (optional -- has sensible defaults).
# {} is replaced with the bead ID at dispatch time.
sling_query = "bd update {} --assignee=worker"

# Custom work query (the read side of dispatch).
# Pool agents must set both sling_query and work_query, or neither.
work_query = "bd ready --assignee=worker --limit=1"

# Nudge text sent to wake the agent after routing.
nudge = "Work slung. Check your hook."
```

Pool agents with default queries:

```toml
[[agent]]
name = "coder"
pool = { min = 1, max = 3, check = "echo 2" }
# Default sling_query: bd update {} --set-metadata gc.routed_to=coder
# Default work_query: bd ready --include-ephemeral --metadata-field gc.routed_to=coder
#   --unassigned --exclude-type=epic --json --sort oldest --limit=1,
#   then a temporary gc.run_target workflow-root migration fallback
```

System formulas are embedded in the `gc` binary and materialized to
`.gc/system-formulas/` at startup. They form the lowest-priority formula
layer (Layer 0) in the formula resolution stack. Pack and city-level
formulas override system formulas by name.

`mol-review-quorum` is provided by the core pack formula layer. Its reviewer
lane IDs, providers, models, and dispatch targets are all supplied through
formula vars; the synthesis target is configured separately with
`synthesis_target`. Each reviewer lane is expected to produce durable structured
output with verdict, findings, evidence, usage, failure classification, and
read-only mutation-baseline delta.
The synthesis step writes the combined `review-quorum.summary.v1` state for
future consumers such as `dx-review summarize`. The `internal/reviewquorum`
Go finalizer defines the durable contract but is not invoked by formula
synthesis yet.

Read-only mutation checks are baseline-relative. Dispatch and review consumers
must compare reviewer after-state to the reviewer-recorded before baseline, not
to an absolute clean-worktree expectation; pre-existing untracked files are not
reviewer-created mutations.

## Testing

Dispatch testing follows the philosophy in
[TESTING.md](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/blob/main/TESTING.md), relying heavily on injected fakes:

**Unit tests** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling_test.go`): All dispatch logic is tested
through `doSling` and `doSlingBatch` with injected `fakeRunner` (records
shell commands), `session.NewFake()` (fake session provider), and
`beads.NewMemStore()` (in-memory bead store). Tests cover:

- `buildSlingCommand` placeholder substitution including multiple `{}`
- Single-bead dispatch to fixed agents and pools
- Formula dispatch with `--formula` flag (wisp instantiation)
- Container expansion: convoy beads expand to open children; epics are rejected
- Merge strategy metadata (`--merge=direct`, `--merge=mr`, `--merge=local`)
- Auto-convoy creation and suppression (`--no-convoy`)
- Owned convoy labeling (`--owned`)
- Pre-flight warnings for already-assigned beads and pool-labeled beads
- Suspended agent and empty pool warnings
- Nudge delivery to fixed agents and first running pool member
- Error paths: runner failure, MolCook failure, store failure

**System formula tests** (`cmd/gc/system_formulas_test.go`): Cover
materialization from embedded FS including empty FS (no-op), file
writing, overwrite semantics, stale file cleanup, idempotency, and
order subdirectory support.

**Config tests** (`internal/config/config_test.go`):
`TestEffectiveSlingQuery*` tests verify default sling query generation
for fixed agents, rig-scoped agents, pool agents, and custom overrides.
`TestValidatePoolWorkQueryMismatch` verifies that pool agents must set
both `sling_query` and `work_query` together or neither.

## Known Limitations

- **Sling query is a shell command, not a Go function call.** Every
  dispatch forks a shell process via `sh -c`. This is simple and
  flexible (any CLI tool can be a routing backend) but adds per-bead
  fork overhead during batch expansion of large containers.

- **Container expansion is serial.** When expanding a convoy,
  each child is slung sequentially. A single slow or failing sling
  command blocks subsequent children. Partial success is reported but
  not retried.

- **No built-in load balancing across pool instances.** Sling routes to
  the pool as a whole (via label), not to a specific instance. Work
  distribution depends on the pool's work query and claim semantics
  (`bd ready --label=pool:<name> --unassigned --limit=1`), which is first-come
  first-served.

- **Nudge targets only one pool instance.** After slinging to a pool,
  `--nudge` wakes the first running instance found. Other instances
  discover work on their next poll cycle.

- **No dry-run mode.** There is no way to preview what a sling command
  would do without actually executing it. The pre-flight `checkBeadState`
  only warns; it does not prevent routing.
