# Changelog

All notable changes to Gas City will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Pin the `beads` dependency to the stable v1.0.4.** v1.3.0 built against
  `beads v1.0.5`, which was subsequently withdrawn (demoted to a pre-release;
  `v1.0.4` is the current stable release). v1.3.1 repins the `beads` Go module
  and the CI `bd` toolchain (`BD_VERSION`) to `v1.0.4`. No behavior change is
  expected — Gas City already defaults to `bd_compatibility = "bd-1.0.4"`
  semantics, and the config still accepts both `bd-1.0.4` and `bd-1.0.5`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-18

### Upgrading Notes

- **Run `gc doctor --fix` once per existing city after upgrading.** The 1.3
  doctor owns the breaking migrations for explicit provider catalogs and
  explicit pack imports/locks. The relevant checks are `provider-catalog`,
  `builtin-pack-imports`, and `packv2-import-state`.
- **Provider references must be declared in `[providers]`.** Cities that set
  `workspace.provider` or agent-level `provider` values now need matching
  `[providers.<name>]` entries. `gc doctor --fix` appends missing built-in
  aliases such as `[providers.claude] base = "builtin:claude"`; custom
  providers still require hand-authored provider tables.
- **Built-in and gastown pack composition changed.** Gas City no longer
  relies on implicit built-ins or per-city `.gc/system/packs` materialization.
  Existing `workspace.includes = [".gc/system/packs/..."]`, legacy public
  `gastown`/`maintenance` import sources, superseded bundled pins, and stale
  locks are migrated to explicit pinned imports in `pack.toml` plus
  `packs.lock`.
- **No control-dispatcher named session is generated.** The control dispatcher
  serves entirely via demand-scaling of the core pack's `core.control-dispatcher`
  agent template (controller work routed through `gc.routed_to =
  "core.control-dispatcher"`), so the on-demand `[[named_session]]` alias older
  builds wrote is redundant. `gc init` no longer creates it, and `gc doctor
  --fix` (during a pack-layout migration) drops the stale alias from upgraded
  cities so its "backing template not found … disabled" warning stops firing.
- **Generated configs no longer pin `formula_v2`.** Formula v2 is on by
  default, so `gc init` omits the `[daemon] formula_v2` line instead of writing
  the default value. An explicit `formula_v2 = false` (or the deprecated
  `graph_workflows = false` alias) is still honored and preserved on round-trip.
- **`gc session logs --tail N` no longer renders blank.** Every transcript
  entry that occupies a tail window now prints at least one line — a non-error
  `tool_result` shows `tool_result: ok`, and any otherwise non-rendering entry
  (empty text, thinking, or an unrecognized block) shows `(no displayable
  content)` — so a tail landing on such entries can no longer produce empty
  output.
- **The built-in Claude provider no longer declares a fresh-start
  `session_id_flag`.** Claude remains resume-capable, but Gas City now records
  the provider-created session key after startup instead of passing a
  preselected fresh-session ID.
- **The `gastown` pack is now consumed from
  `github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs`.** The old checked-in
  `examples/gastown/packs/gastown` tree is gone. Move local customizations
  into an explicitly imported pack instead of editing `.gc/system/packs` or
  the retired vendored example path.
- **Fallback agents were removed.** Packs that previously depended on a
  fallback dog/worker must ship their own worker pool and formulas. Cross-pack
  agent name collisions are now hard errors.
- **Public imports are intentionally small.** Authored `[imports.<binding>]`
  tables expose `source` and optional `version`; older `export`,
  `transitive`, and `shadow` keys remain compatibility-only loader behavior,
  not public schema.
- **Formula v2 targeted executions use `convoy_id`, not `bead_id`.**
  Graph/formula v2 templates no longer receive `{{bead_id}}`; update them to
  use the reserved `{{convoy_id}}` variable for the input convoy. Formula v2
  rejects authored inputs named `convoy_id` or `bead_id`, and `{{issue}}`
  remains only a temporary compatibility alias that should be migrated too.

### Changed

- **Version pins on builtin packs are honored: the binary only pre-seeds
  its embedded content at each pack's canonical pin.** Previously the
  bundled synthetic cache served the running binary's embedded bytes for
  ANY commit pinned on a bundled source — editing the pin changed nothing.
  Now only the canonical pin (the one `gc init` writes) resolves from the
  embedded copy; a bundled source pinned at any other commit behaves
  exactly like a regular remote import: `gc import install` fetches that
  exact commit from git, validation uses the git checkout, and the cache
  slot uses the plain remote key. Cities on canonical pins keep working
  fully offline, including across binary upgrades that keep the pin
  constants; releases that bump a canonical pin migrate existing cities
  via `gc doctor --fix` (superseded canonical pins are rewritten to the
  current one).

- **Builtin packs are no longer materialized into cities; they compose via
  pinned imports resolved from the user-global pack cache.** The per-city
  `.gc/system/packs` tree is retired (and pruned on sight): `gc init` now
  writes pinned `[imports.core]`/`[imports.bd]` entries into pack.toml plus
  a matching packs.lock, and the gc binary self-heals the GC_HOME cache
  (`$GC_HOME/cache/repos`) with its own embedded content so the pins resolve
  offline. The `builtin-pack-includes` doctor check became
  `builtin-pack-imports`: it migrates legacy `workspace.includes =
  [".gc/system/packs/..."]` cities by stripping the includes, upserting the
  pinned imports (creating a minimal pack.toml for legacy cities), and
  refreshing packs.lock and the cache. The bd lifecycle script moved behind
  a stable per-city shim at `.gc/scripts/gc-beads-bd.sh` that execs the
  cache-resolved bundled script; provider normalization still recognizes
  the legacy materialized path. All repo-cache roots (packman install,
  config resolution, doctor) now uniformly resolve via GC_HOME instead of
  mixing `$HOME/.gc` and GC_HOME. `gc rig add --include <builtin>`
  canonicalizes to the bundled remote source and locks it. **Migration:**
  run `gc doctor --fix` once per existing city.

- **The registry `gascity` planning pack is bundled and offered by the init
  wizard.** `gc init` now offers `gascity` as a config template alongside
  minimal/gastown (also via `--template gascity`), wiring the pinned public
  import from gascity-packs the same way the gastown template does. The
  pack is embedded from the `github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs` module
  root, so the pin resolves offline from the bundled synthetic cache.

- **The bundled gastown pack is now a Go module dependency, not a checked-in
  copy.** `examples/gastown/packs/gastown` is gone; the gc binary embeds the
  pack from `github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs` (pinned in go.mod to the
  registry release commit), and the example city composes gastown through
  the pinned public registry import plus a committed `packs.lock` — the same
  shape `gc init` writes — resolved offline from the bundled synthetic
  cache. `scripts/update-bundled-gastown-pack` no longer writes a vendored
  tree; it bumps the go.mod pin, the `PublicGastownPack*` constants, and the
  example pins from the latest registry release, and `--check` verifies the
  pinned module content against the registry hash. The gastown integration
  tests in `examples/gastown` now run against the module-embedded bytes, so
  a runtime/pack mismatch fails in gascity CI.

- **The bundled maintenance pack was folded into the core pack, and builtin
  packs compose only through explicit pinned imports.** The bundled `core`
  pack carries the gc-* skills, default worker prompts, core formulas, the
  mechanical housekeeping orders that used to ship in the maintenance pack
  (gate-sweep, orphan-sweep, cross-rig-deps, order-tracking-sweep,
  spawn-storm-detect, prune-branches, wisp-compact, nudge-mail-sweep,
  nudge-on-route, cascade-nudge-on-blocker-close), the check-binaries doctor
  check, and the per-provider hook overlays. Config load no longer splices
  builtin packs into composition: `gc init` writes explicit `[imports.core]`
  and, for default bd-provider cities, `[imports.bd]` entries into
  `pack.toml`, plus a matching `packs.lock`. The fixable
  `builtin-pack-imports` doctor check repairs missing imports and migrates
  legacy `workspace.includes = [".gc/system/packs/..."]` cities by stripping
  those includes, adding the pinned imports, and pruning stale
  `.gc/system/packs` materialization. **Migration:** run `gc doctor --fix`
  once per existing city.
- **The implicit fallback dog is gone, and the `fallback` agent field was
  removed.** The gastown pack now owns its dog pool outright
  (`agents/dog/`, themed, with `mol-shutdown-dance`), and the dolt pack
  keeps its own dolt dog for Dolt maintenance formulas. The
  fallback-agent resolution mechanism (`fallback = true`, non-fallback
  wins, first-loaded wins) was removed: cross-pack agent name collisions
  are now hard errors, and a stale `fallback` key in a V2
  `agents/<name>/agent.toml` is ignored while a V1 inline `[[agent]]`
  entry fails the pack's unknown-key gate. External packs that relied on
  the bundled fallback dog must define their own worker pool (or route
  work to a pool they ship themselves).

### Added

- **Early access: the public `gascity-packs` collection.** v1.3.0 ships the
  first early-access release of
  [`gascity-packs`](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs) — an opt-in
  collection of Gas City packs composed via `pack.toml` `[imports]`. Add one
  with e.g.
  `gc import add --name gc https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity-packs.git//gascity`.
  Featured packs:
  - **`gascity`** — planning & implementation workflow pack; bundled in the
    release and the default `gc init` template (also `--template gascity`).
  - **`gastown`** — multi-agent orchestration / default coding workflow pack;
    bundled and offered by `gc init` (`--template gastown`).
  - **`compound-engineering`** (`compound-build`) — Every Inc.'s Compound
    Engineering methodology as a build factory: brainstorm/plan → persona-panel
    plan review → implement → wide reviewer-persona fanout → resolution.
  - **`gstack`** (`gstack-build`) — garrytan/gstack founder-style sprint:
    office-hours intake → multi-perspective plan review → staff review → QA →
    security → release readiness.
  - **`superpowers`** (`superpowers-build`) — Jesse Vincent's Superpowers skill
    library as a build factory: brainstorm → written-spec approval → per-task
    TDD → spec-compliance then code-quality review.
  `gascity` and `gastown` are in the supported registry; the three
  build-methodology packs (`compound-engineering`, `gstack`, `superpowers`) are
  early access and each import `gascity` as `gc`. See the gascity-packs README
  for the full list and import instructions.

- **Formulas v2 and `drain` are the supported path for new graph
  workflows.** The v2 compiler emits flat workflow graphs with
  controller-owned control/finalize beads, and `drain` is now the canonical
  fan-out primitive for scattering convoy members into per-item formula runs.
  The bundled `gascity` planning pack ships graph.v2 build and implementation
  formulas, including the mayor skill's documented `gc sling ... --on
  <formula>` launch flow and drain-based `implement` workflow, so new Gas City
  methodology workflows no longer need the legacy `gc.output_json`/tally fan-out
  pattern.

- Proxy-process workspace services now receive `GC_SERVICE_SECRETS_DIR`
  (`<GC_SERVICE_STATE_ROOT>/secrets`) in their environment, alongside the
  existing `GC_SERVICE_*` variables. The directory is scaffolded at `0700`
  by the service state-root setup and is the sanctioned home for
  pack-managed credentials (bot tokens etc.), so pack services can rely on
  the explicit contract instead of deriving the path from
  `GC_SERVICE_STATE_ROOT`. See #3429.
- `gc nudge drain --inject` now prepends a one-line current-time stamp
  (operator-local + UTC + epoch) to its `UserPromptSubmit` hook output, giving
  agents a live clock in context every turn. The local zone follows the host
  (`time.Local`/`$TZ`) or the `GC_OPERATOR_TZ` override; disable with
  `GC_INJECT_CLOCK=0`. Folded into the existing nudge inject, so it adds zero
  extra hook subprocesses per turn. See #3036.
- The supervisor now merges a machine-local secrets file
  (`${GC_HOME}/secrets.env`, dotenv syntax) into the launchd plist / systemd
  unit environment on every service-file regeneration. This fixes provider
  credentials being dropped when `gc start` runs from a shell that did not
  export them (e.g. at login or after a reboot), which previously caused
  silent provider auth failures. Only keys already eligible for the supervisor
  environment are merged (provider credentials plus `GC_SUPERVISOR_ENV`
  opt-ins); a value exported in the calling shell still takes precedence, and
  `GC_SUPERVISOR_OMIT_PROVIDER_CREDS=1` suppresses provider credentials from
  both sources.
- `GC_DOLT_SYNC_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS` configures the SQL-mode push wall-clock
  ceiling for `gc dolt sync` (default 1800s, replacing the prior fixed 120s
  that SIGKILLed large first pushes). Metadata queries keep their own 120s
  bound.
- **ENOSPC pre-flight for managed Dolt** (`GC_DOLT_MIN_FREE_BYTES`,
  `GC_DOLT_WARN_FREE_BYTES`): managed-Dolt startup and the store-maintenance
  compaction loop now check container free space via `statvfs(2)` before
  performing disk-growing operations. Below the critical floor (default
  500 MiB) startup is refused and compaction is skipped; below the soft floor
  (default 2 GiB) a `gc.store.disk_warn` event is emitted and operations
  proceed. Fails open on probe error and is disabled entirely when
  `GC_DOLT_MIN_FREE_BYTES=0`. Uses `f_bavail` (APFS-safe — excludes purgeable
  space). Addresses the root trigger of the 2026-06-01 fleet-drain incident.

### Fixed

- The synthetic bundled-pack cache key now folds in the running binary's
  embedded-pack content hash, so two `gc` binaries with different bundled-pack
  content resolve to different cache directories instead of fighting over one.
  Previously the cache directory was keyed only on namespace+source+commit, so a
  version-skewed deploy (controller and agents on different `gc` builds) left
  both binaries materializing one shared directory in turn: each `gc import
  install` was promptly clobbered by the other binary, re-wedging every `gc bd`
  citywide with "bundled pack cache content hash does not match current binary"
  roughly hourly. With the content hash in the key, `gc import install` for a
  given binary sticks for that binary regardless of other versions running.
  Note: deploying a binary with changed bundled-pack content still requires a
  one-time `gc import install` (or bootstrap materialize) to populate the new
  cache directory; that install is now durable rather than transient (ga-s9p).

- Pool respawn after `gc runtime drain-ack` no longer waits up to a full patrol
  interval (default 60 s) before the replacement session starts. The async kill
  goroutine now pokes the controller once after the session is gone so Phase 2
  (finalize bead + spawn replacement) runs on the next event tick. Fixes the
  `TestLifecycle_DrainAckResponsiveRespawn/prequeued_respawn_2364` Tier B
  nightly regression (ga-ryhnhd, #2364, #2251).

- `gc dolt sync` now emits per-mode diagnostics on push failure instead of a
  generic "push failed": a TIMEOUT message naming the ceiling and
  `GC_DOLT_SYNC_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS` on exit 124, the underlying exit code on
  other failures, and the underlying dolt stderr. The replayed stderr cannot
  leak `GC_DOLT_PASSWORD`: the password reaches dolt via the `DOLT_CLI_PASSWORD`
  environment variable, never as an argv flag. `GC_DOLT_SYNC_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS`
  rejects every numeric-zero form (`0`, `00`, `000`, ...) -- not just the
  literal `0` -- because GNU `timeout` treats a zero duration as "disable the
  timeout", which would push unbounded. A failure to create the stderr-capture
  temp file now degrades to a per-database error rather than aborting the whole
  run.
- Interactive `gc session new` tmux sessions now scroll tmux scrollback on the
  mouse wheel instead of leaking the wheel to the focused TUI (Claude Code's own
  history, a pager, or the shell). The gastown pack binds `WheelUpPane`→copy-mode
  and `WheelDownPane`→passthrough, and the runtime resolves interactive sessions
  to mouse-on across every create seam so tmux preserves the `mouse on` set at
  session create: the `gc session new` CLI — both the managed-deferred reconciler
  start (`templateParamsToConfig`, for `session_origin=manual` sessions) and the
  unmanaged direct start (`workerSessionCreateHints`) — plus the API
  provider/named paths (`sessionCreateHints`). Resume keeps mouse-on too
  (`sessionResumeHints`), so the wheel survives suspend/restart. Headless agent
  sessions stay mouse-off (controller-poll safety) — they resolve `MouseOn` from
  the agent template path (`cfgAgent.MouseModeOn()`), which is unchanged and has
  neither the `manual`/`named` interactive marker. Replaces the portharbour
  po-vtg2 city-local `set-hook` stopgap with the in-source fix. Refs: ga-c4w.

### Troubleshooting (packs, imports, registry)

v1.3.0 changed pack composition: built-in/gastown packs are now consumed via
explicit pinned `[imports]` in `pack.toml` + `packs.lock`, served from a
content-hashed cache under `~/.gc/cache/repos/` (nothing is materialized into
`.gc/system/packs` anymore). Most upgrade issues are fixed by one command — run
it once per existing city after upgrading:

```
gc doctor --fix
```

It owns the mechanical migrations (`provider-catalog`, `builtin-pack-imports`,
`packv2-import-state`): it adds missing pinned imports, strips legacy
`workspace.includes` / `[packs]` surfaces, re-pins superseded canonical
versions, refreshes `packs.lock` + cache, and prunes leftover `.gc/system/packs`.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `does not import required builtin pack(s) core; run "gc doctor --fix"` | City predates explicit `[imports]`. | `gc doctor --fix` |
| `workspace.includes is deprecated in v2; use [imports]` / `[packs] is deprecated` / `unsupported PackV1` | Legacy v1 composition surfaces. | `gc doctor --fix` (a fragment-authored `[packs]` may need a manual edit) |
| `remote import <src> is not installed (missing packs.lock); run "gc import install"` | Declared import lacks a lock pin, or its cache checkout is absent. | `gc import install` (diagnose with `gc import check` / `gc import status`) |
| `synthetic cache is invalid at <dir>: missing bundled pack cache marker` | Bundled synthetic cache present but invalid (an *absent* cache self-heals offline). | `gc import install` |
| `N bundled import(s) pinned at a superseded canonical version` | Stale `packs.lock` from an older `gc`. | `gc doctor --fix` (offline re-pin) |
| `durable import(s) use command-time registry selectors` | A `registry:` selector was written into `pack.toml`. | Manual edit — replace with the concrete source (`gc pack registry show <pack>`) |
| `gc start` prints `FATAL: pack schema 2 not supported` | A stale supervisor still on the old binary. | let `gc start` auto-restart, or `systemctl --user restart gascity-supervisor` |

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- Built-in pack auto-includes now skip packs already reachable from rig pack
  graphs, preventing duplicate maintenance agents when a rig pack imports a
  built-in pack transitively.
- CI, docs, the managed minimum check, and install helpers now pin Dolt 2.1.0
  so hotfix validation and runtime dependency checks use the same Dolt floor.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Claude Opus 4.8 is now listed in built-in Claude model choices and default
  pricing. The `opus` model choice targets `claude-opus-4-8`; `opus-4-7`
  remains available for cities that need the prior Opus target. Anthropic's
  published regular-usage pricing is unchanged from Opus 4.7: $5/MTok input
  and $25/MTok output.
- `[daemon].dolt_start_address_in_use_retry_window` configures how long the
  managed dolt start path waits on the originally requested port when bind
  fails with "address already in use" before falling back to a higher port.
  Defaults to `30s`, which roughly covers half of Linux's default TCP
  TIME_WAIT and prevents an external `kill -TERM` / supervisor restart / OOM
  kill of the dolt subprocess from perpetuating a rebound orphan on a
  non-canonical port. Each port gets at most one wait per
  `startManagedDoltProcessWithOptions` invocation, so the worst-case wall
  time per startup is bounded by `(retry_window + per-attempt-startup) ×
  min(5, distinct-ports-tried)` rather than `retry_window × 5`. Set to `0s`
  to disable the retry (legacy fall-back-immediately behavior). Operators
  with a recovery-latency monitor may want to raise their alert threshold
  by ~30s to absorb the new wait under contended port conditions; the
  worst-case per startup remains well under one minute at defaults.
  During a same-port retry the managed-dolt state file briefly reports
  `Running:false, PID:0` for up to `retry_window` while the wait elapses;
  state-readers (`gc dolt-state status`, rig endpoint port projection,
  order routing) treat this as transient not-running and recover on the
  next successful bind. The provider-op timeout for `start` remains `120s`;
  an operator who raises `dolt_start_address_in_use_retry_window` materially
  above the default should also raise that timeout to keep headroom for the
  5-attempt cap.
- `[daemon].dolt_stop_timeout` typos are now caught by `ValidateDurations`
  at config load (previously only `ValidateNonNegativeDurations` covered it,
  so an invalid string like `"30sec"` silently collapsed to zero).

### Fixed

- `gc mail reply` and `gc handoff` now store created mail in the wisp tier,
  matching `gc mail send`. Operators should use `gc mail` commands or
  explicit both-tier/wisp-aware bead queries for mail visibility; default
  issue-tier `bd list` output and git sync do not include wisp-tier messages.
- Built-in pack auto-include graph traversal now avoids redundant pack reads
  while preserving non-transitive import boundaries and later transitive
  expansion of shallow-seen packs.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- `gc mail inbox`, `gc mail read`, `gc mail peek`, `gc mail thread`,
  and `gc mail count` now accept `--json` and emit schema-versioned result
  envelopes for script and dashboard consumers. `gc mail inbox --json` and
  `gc mail count --json` always include the resolved `recipients` array,
  including single-recipient targets.
- Native `bd` store selection now links the upstream Beads/Dolt Go library
  stack into `gc` when the default beads provider is built. This intentionally
  increases binary size and supply-chain surface through the Dolt/Vitess and
  cloud-provider SDK dependency closure; deployments that do not want that
  path can keep using `GC_BEADS_FORCE_FALLBACK=1` or `GC_BEADS=file`. CI now
  runs `make check-native-dependency-surface` to fail on unreviewed native
  dependency-family growth or `gc` binary-size growth.

### Fixed

- `gc runtime drain-ack` now pokes the city controller socket after setting
  the drain-ack flag, so the reconciler stops and respawns a drained pool
  worker on the current patrol tick instead of waiting up to four ticks
  (~120 s/step → ~30–90 s/step). Closes #2364 (pre-queued work) and #2251
  (cold-pool arrival after drain-ack), which shared the same missing-poke
  root cause.
- `gc --json-schema` manifest output no longer includes the removed
  `transport` field. Consumers should use each role schema's `x-gc-jsonl`
  extension, when present, to determine JSONL record-count behavior.
- `gc session attach` now re-applies `session_live` hooks (status-bar theme,
  keybindings) when it recreates a session whose tmux runtime had exited.
  Previously the resume path in `resolvedWorkerRuntimeWithConfigAndMetadata`
  built the runtime `Hints` without `SessionLive`, so `runSessionLive`
  early-returned on the empty list and attach-recreated sessions came up
  unthemed while reconciler-started sessions did not. The setup context is
  built via the reconciler's own `sessionSetupContextForAgent` so
  `session_live` templates referencing `{{.Rig}}`/`{{.RigRoot}}`/`{{.AgentBase}}`
  expand correctly on the resume path.
- Managed bd provider startup now detects a bd-standalone dolt server running
  against the same `.beads/dolt` database before invoking the managed-bd
  lifecycle script, and refuses with a message naming `bd dolt stop` as the
  unblock. This covers `gc start`, `gc init`, and `gc rig add` provider
  convergence paths. Previously, running `bd dolt start` while a city was
  registered at the same path would leave the standalone dolt holding the
  exclusive write lock; the city-managed dolt could not acquire it and startup
  failed with a generic "dolt server could not start via gc helper" error that
  did not point at the lock holder. Stale `.beads/dolt-server.pid` files and
  live PIDs that do not look like `dolt sql-server` are ignored so leftover
  files and PID reuse do not block startup.
- Default bead-backed pool-demand counts now use the same routed target
  resolution as worker claim queries and exclude epic-routed beads, matching
  the default worker `work_query` behavior. Custom `scale_check` overrides are
  unchanged.
- Empty JSON result collections for `gc mail thread`, `gc trace status`, and
  `gc trace show` now encode as `[]` instead of `null`; `gc trace show` also
  reports a concise no-records message in the default text mode.
- `events.FileRecorder.Record` no longer blocks indefinitely on `flock` when
  a prior `gc event emit` process died holding the lock. Acquisition now
  uses non-blocking `LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB` retried at a 5 ms cadence for up to
  250 ms total, then logs `events: lock: timed out after 250ms waiting on
  flock at <path>` to stderr and returns without recording. The deferred
  `LOCK_UN` still runs after a successful acquire; the happy path and
  non-`EWOULDBLOCK` flock-error path are unchanged. Operators previously
  saw hundreds of stuck `gc event emit` processes after a `SIGKILL` of the
  holder; the new bounded wait drops the stuck event recorder instead of
  stacking processes.
- Kiro provider launch behavior is now explicit in release notes and provider
  docs: the built-in Kiro provider starts `kiro-cli` with `chat`,
  `--no-interactive`, `--agent gascity`, and `--trust-all-tools` by default.
  Operators who do not want unrestricted tool trust can replace the full
  default argv with an explicit `[providers.kiro].args` list in `city.toml`.
- Tmux and runtime provider-overlay staging now surface nonfatal preservation
  warnings on stderr, including the Kiro `AGENTS.md` preservation notice when
  project instructions already exist.
- `jsonl-export.sh` no longer mis-classifies a bead database with an empty
  `issues` table as a failed export. `dolt sql -r json` returns `{}` (not
  `{"rows":[]}`) when a queried table is empty; `validate_exported_issues` now
  treats the bare-object form as zero rows so the database lands in the
  success path with an `issues.jsonl` committed to the archive instead of
  appearing in the `failed:` summary.
- The built-in `control-dispatcher` trace now defaults to
  `${GC_CITY_RUNTIME_DIR}/control-dispatcher-trace.log` (falling back to
  `${GC_CITY}/.gc/runtime/control-dispatcher-trace.log`) instead of writing at
  city root. This keeps workflow-trace appends inside the controller's
  watcher-excluded runtime subtree, avoiding continuous `config-changed`
  reconciliations. After upgrading, operators tailing the default trace should
  switch to `.gc/runtime/control-dispatcher-trace.log`; the old
  `${GC_CITY}/control-dispatcher-trace.log` file becomes stale and can be
  removed. After upgrading, restart or recycle existing `control-dispatcher`
  sessions so they pick up the new trace path; otherwise they keep their
  previous trace target and can continue retriggering reconciles. Validation
  currently covers watcher exclusion, dispatcher warning routing, and the
  graph-workflow integration shard; there is not yet a dedicated patrol-cadence
  stress test.
- `proxy_process` services now receive a `GC_SERVICE_URL_PREFIX` that the
  supervisor's public listener actually routes. Previously the prefix was
  the per-city-relative `/svc/<name>`, so any service that composed
  `CallbackURL = $GC_API_BASE_URL + $GC_SERVICE_URL_PREFIX` (the documented
  shape for adapter self-registration) would 404 on inbound calls. The
  prefix is now the full `/v0/city/<cityName>/svc/<svcName>` path. The
  per-city router contract (`config.Service.MountPathOrDefault`) is
  unchanged.
- `gc session reset` now documents its named-session circuit-breaker behavior:
  when the target is a named session, reset clears a tripped respawn breaker
  before requesting a fresh restart.

### Changed

- `gc converge status --json` returns the convergence metadata object with
  `ok: true` injected. `gc converge list --json` returns an object with
  `ok: true` and `entries`. These converge JSON outputs do not include a
  `schema_version` field.
- `gc runtime drain-check --json` now emits a JSON result when the target
  session is not draining, with `ok: true`, `draining: false`, and the
  existing shell-condition exit code of 1.
- `gc sling --json` now emits one JSONL result record, matching its checked-in
  result schema; earlier JSON support emitted an indented multi-line object.
- `gc trace status` and `gc trace show` now default to human-readable output;
  scripts that need machine-readable trace data should pass `--json`. The
  `--json` result shapes are also envelope objects now: `gc trace status
  --json` uses `active_arms` instead of `arms` and includes
  `schema_version`, `as_of`, `controller_running`, and `controller_pid`;
  `gc trace show --json` returns `schema_version`, `city_path`, `count`, and
  `records` instead of a bare record array. See
  `schemas/trace/status/result.schema.json` and
  `schemas/trace/show/result.schema.json` for the exact contracts.
  During rolling upgrades, trace controller socket status replies include the
  legacy `arms` alias and upgraded CLIs still accept `arms` from older
  controllers.
- Pack import cache validation now requires commit abbreviations in
  `packs.lock` to be at least seven characters long. Shorter abbreviations
  should be refreshed with `gc import install`.
- City discovery now treats a `city.toml` at `$HOME` or an explicit
  `GC_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` entry as a valid city. The ceiling directory is
  searched but never crossed, so existing stray `$HOME/city.toml` files may now
  be discovered from subdirectories where they were previously ignored.
- `gc import migrate` is now a hidden, deprecated guidance shim that exits
  non-zero after pointing operators to `gc doctor` and `gc doctor --fix`.
  Update any scripts that treated `gc import migrate` as a successful
  compatibility migration step.
- `gc rig add --include` now writes canonical `rig.Imports`, which are
  processed alphabetically by binding rather than in legacy declaration order.
- `examples/swarm` now inherits the system-maintenance `dog` agent, so the
  example city has the same fallback agent as other maintenance-enabled
  cities.
- ACP, subprocess, and Kubernetes session staging now apply pack and agent
  overlays through the provider-aware `per-provider/<provider>/` contract.
  Custom ACP overlays that previously expected a literal `per-provider/`
  subtree in the session workdir should move provider-specific files under the
  matching provider slot so they are flattened at launch.
- The review-quorum durable contract now documents that synthesized
  `findings_count` is deduplicated, top-level `mutations_delta` is reserved for
  synthesis-created changes, lane mutation deltas remain under their lane
  records, lane-scoped finalizer failures use
  `lane=<lane_id> reason=<stable_reason>` entries, and unknown lane verdict
  values are hard contract failures. Reviewer lane prompts now require durable
  `lane_id`, `provider`, and `model` fields, and the finalizer rejects blank
  lane IDs without merging contract-invalid lane findings, evidence, or usage
  into the synthesized summary.
- `[[orders.overrides]]` rig matching is stricter and clearer. A rigless
  override (`rig` unset) still matches **only** city-level orders; if the
  named order exists only as per-rig instances, the error now names every
  matching rig so it's obvious what to type. `rig = "*"` is a new wildcard
  that targets every instance of the named order (city-level + per-rig).
  The literal `"*"` is reserved and rejected as a real rig name by config
  validation.
- Managed Dolt config now emits listener backlog and connection-timeout keys.
  Existing managed cities may see a `dolt-config` doctor warning until
  `gc dolt restart` or the next managed server start regenerates
  `dolt-config.yaml`.
- In bead-backed pool reconciliation, `scale_check` output is now documented
  and enforced as additive new-session demand. Assigned work is resumed
  separately; custom checks that previously returned total desired sessions
  should return only new unassigned demand.
- Session bead reconciliation now stops suspended and orphaned runtimes before
  closing their beads; resuming one of those sessions starts a fresh lifecycle
  instead of continuing the previous runtime process.
- `gc hook --inject` is now silent legacy compatibility for already-installed
  Stop/session-end hooks. Fresh managed hook configs no longer install it;
  routed work pickup should happen through the SessionStart claim protocol or
  an explicit non-inject `gc hook` call.
- The built-in Claude provider's `model = "opus"` option now emits
  `claude-opus-4-7`. Cities that rely on the `opus` alias should expect the
  new model target after upgrading.

### Fixed

- Linux systemd supervisor service restarts now preserve managed tmux sessions
  for re-adoption. Linux users should rerun `gc supervisor install` after
  upgrading so the user unit is regenerated with `KillMode=process` and the
  preserve-on-signal environment. If the currently active Linux supervisor
  predates the preserve-on-signal environment, `gc supervisor install` now
  refuses the warm refresh before sending a signal and tells operators to stop
  or drain agents intentionally with `gc supervisor stop --wait`, then rerun the
  install. Once the active supervisor already supports preserve mode, Linux warm
  refresh sends the main supervisor PID `SIGTERM` first so preserve-mode
  shutdown can close workspace services and flush traces, with a bounded
  `SIGKILL` fallback if the process does not exit. The Linux refresh also stops
  orphan-prone workspace service process groups owned by registered cities
  before starting the replacement supervisor; supervisor startup repeats the
  same owned-service cleanup after crashes. Service-managed `SIGTERM` preserves
  sessions for re-adoption, while `SIGINT` remains a destructive escalation
  path. Preserve mode intentionally leaves the beads provider running so
  preserved sessions can keep using the store; the bundled managed-Dolt start
  path is idempotent when it finds an already-running server, but custom exec
  providers must make `start` reattach or no-op safely after preserve-mode
  restarts. macOS launchd upgrades still use launchd unload/load rather than the
  Linux main-PID refresh path; macOS supervisor startup now warns that automatic
  orphaned workspace-service cleanup is Linux-only, lists the registered
  `GC_SERVICE_STATE_ROOT` roots to inspect, and tells operators to stop stale
  workspace-service processes before restarting affected cities after
  non-graceful exits.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-21

First stable release. Between `v0.15.1` and `v1.0.0` the project received 610
commits across 1,273 files (+303,902 / −46,437) from the core team and 12
community contributors. See the GitHub release page for the full narrative.

### Added

- `gc reload [path]` — structured live config reload. Failures keep the previous
  runtime config active instead of silently degrading.
- `gc prime --strict` — turns silent prompt/agent fallback paths into explicit
  CLI failures for debugging.
- `rig adopt` — adopt existing rigs without a full rebuild.
- Provider-native MCP projection for Claude, Codex, and Gemini, with multi-layer
  catalog resolution and projected-only `gc mcp list`.
- Per-agent `append_fragments` so prompt layering is configurable through the
  supported config and migration paths.
- Wave 1 pass over orders and dispatch runtime — store resolution, dispatch
  surfaces, rig-aware execution, and verifier coverage.

### Changed

- **Session model unified.** Declarative `[[agent]]` policy/config is now
  cleanly separated from runtime session identity; session beads are the
  canonical runtime projection.
- **Pack V2 is the active layout.** Bundled packs use `[imports.<name>]`;
  builtin formulas, prompts, hooks, and orders come from the builtin `core`
  pack. V1-era city-local seeding is retired.
- `gc init` is back on the pack-first scaffold contract. Agent and named
  sessions belong in `pack.toml`; machine-local identity stays in
  `.gc/site.toml`; `city.toml` keeps workspace/provider state.
- `gc import install` is now the explicit bootstrap path for importable packs.
- `gc session logs --tail N` returns the last `N` entries (matches Unix `tail`
  convention) instead of the old compaction-oriented behavior.
- Supervisor API migrated to Huma/OpenAPI; Go client regenerated; dashboard SPA
  restored.
- Order "gates" renamed to **triggers**.

### Fixed

- Startup proofs for hook-enabled providers — correct startup prompt delivery,
  no duplicate `SessionStart` hook context, no replay of startup prompts on
  resumed sessions.
- Managed Dolt hardening: recovery, transient failures, health probes,
  runtime-state validation, and late-cycle macOS portability fixes (start-lock
  FD inheritance, path canonicalization, `lsof` reachability, PID confirmation,
  portable `sed` parsing).
- Pack V2 tmux startup regression where large prompt launches could silently
  fall back to the known-broken inline path.
- Custom provider option defaults now fail early instead of silently degrading.
- Beads storage core quality pass — cache recovery, close-all fallback
  semantics, watchdog reconciliation cadence, dirty-cache fallback reads.
- Long tail of session lifecycle, wake-budget, and pool identity fixes.
