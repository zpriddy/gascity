// Package storeref resolves a bead id to the store that physically owns it,
// across the work store and the relocated coordination-class SQLite stores.
//
// It is the standalone successor to coordrouter.Router's by-id read federation
// (prefixBackendForID + Get): the Router is the live graph_store=sqlite wiring
// today and is retired in the final phase of the infra/beads split, so this
// package carries the same routing forward over an explicit []beads.Store the
// caller assembles, with no central Router. Bead ids are prefix-disjoint across
// stores (reserved class prefixes are kept off HQ/rig work-store prefixes by
// config.ValidateRigs), so the owning store is the sole residence.
