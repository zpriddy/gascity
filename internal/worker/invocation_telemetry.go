// recordInvocationTelemetry emits gc.agent.tokens.* and
// gc.agent.invocation.cost_usd for usage-bearing transcript entries that
// completed since the session's persisted invocation-usage cursor
// (session.MetadataKeyInvocationUsageCursor), and — when the handle has a live
// usage sink — emits one model usage.Fact per entry to that sink (the data
// behind gc costs and external aggregators). Both consume the same extracted
// per-invocation usage and the same cursor, so token metrics and model facts
// stay aligned. It is called at
// prompt-operation (message/nudge) finish: prompt submission returns at
// keystroke-delivery time, so the transcript tail at that point holds
// previously COMPLETED invocations — the turn this operation triggers is
// recorded by the next prompt operation on the session. Entries beyond the
// extractor's scan window (a 64KB tail for claude and codex) or after the
// final prompt op of a session go unrecorded.
//
// Coverage is per transcript provider family, driven by the
// invocationUsageSpecs registry, with per-family discovery bounds:
//
//   - claude: Manager.TranscriptPath (session-key stat or ambiguity-guarded
//     project-slug listing — cheap) + the Claude JSONL tail extractor.
//   - codex: identity-first. When the session bead carries a session_key
//     (captured from the codex hook; codex rollout filenames end in the
//     same uuid), the rollout is resolved by that suffix via
//     sessionlog.FindCodexSessionFileByID over the day dirs between bead
//     creation and the wake anchor — this is what keeps telemetry alive for
//     resumed sessions, whose rollout filename timestamp is the FIRST start
//     and predates every later wake. A keyed miss records nothing: a
//     window-found rollout with a different suffix would be misattribution.
//     Without a session_key (fresh start before the hook fires),
//     sessionlog.FindCodexSessionFileNear anchored at the session's
//     last_woke_at metadata (falling back to bead creation time) opens only
//     the rollout day directories intersecting the anchor window. Neither
//     route uses Manager.TranscriptPath, whose codex route walks the full
//     date tree (multi-second scans inside a prompt operation). Un-keyed
//     sessions whose rollout began outside the window (for example
//     crash-adopted sessions whose last_woke_at was cleared, or codex CLIs
//     running under a different local timezone than this process — rollout
//     filenames are local-time and parsed in gc's time.Local) silently
//     record nothing: bounded best-effort by design.
//
// Families without a registered spec are skipped before any discovery —
// their workdir-based fallbacks walk real session stores and no usage
// extractor exists for their transcript formats.
//
// Cost is skipped entirely (not zero-filled) when the pricing registry has
// no entry for the (provider family, model) pair, so missing pricing data is
// never mistaken for free usage. gc.agent.invocation.latency_ms is
// intentionally NOT recorded here: no measured per-invocation latency source
// exists, and the wrapping operation's DurationMs is explicitly excluded by
// RecordInvocationLatency's contract.
//
// Best-effort by design: all errors are swallowed so telemetry never affects
// operations. The persisted cursor (the message identity of the last
// recorded invocation) dedupes across prompt-operation boundaries, but the
// read-record-persist sequence is not atomic: concurrent prompt ops on the
// same session — whether in separate processes or on separate handles in one
// process (the API server constructs a fresh handle per request) — can each
// read the same stale cursor and double-record the pending batch.
// invTelemetryMu only serializes ops that share a single handle instance.
// Accepted as best-effort. RuntimeHandle prompt ops are permanently out of
// scope (decided in ga-tkvb31, not a pending gap): runtime-only sessions
// have no transcript adapter, no session bead for the cursor, and no agent
// identity, and will not gain bead-backed identity just for telemetry.
